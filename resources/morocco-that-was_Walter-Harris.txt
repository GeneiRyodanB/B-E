MOROCCO    THAT    WAS. 


THE   MOORISH   COURT. 


THE   ACCESSION   OF  MULAI  ABDUL   AZIZ. 

MY  first  introduction  to  the  Moorish  Court  was 
in  1887,  only  a  very  few  months  after  my  arrival 
in  Morocco,  when  I  was  invited  by  the  British 
Minister,  the  late  Sir  William  Kirby-Green,  to 
accompany  his  special  Mission  to  the  Sultan. 

Mulai  Hassen  was  then  at  the  zenith  of  his 
power.  He  was  a  "  strong "  Sultan,  probably 
cruel,  and  certainly  capable.  His  energy  was 
never-failing,  and  he  maintained  order  amongst 
his  lawless  tribes  and  stamped  out  the  constantly 
occurring  revolts  by  an  almost  unceasing  "pro- 
gress "  through  the  country,  accompanied  by  his 
rabble  of  an  army.  He  seldom  spent  six  months 
together  in  any  of  his  several  capitals,  and  the 
Moors  had  a  saying,  "  The  Imperial  tents  are 
never  stored." 

The  great  labour,  the  enormous  transport  that 
these  journeyings  necessitated,  is  difficult  to  appre- 

A

ciate.  Not  only  was  the  Sultan  accompanied  by 
his  numerous  ladies  and  all  his  viziers  and  their 
families  and  suites,  but  he  had  with  him  as  well 
some  ten  thousand  soldiers  and  a  rabble  of  camp- 
followers.  A  large  number  of  native  merchants 
also  joined  the  throng,  for  trade  flowed  to  the 
region  in  which  the  Court  was  residing. 

Some  idea  of  the  results  upon  the  country 
passed  through  can  be  imagined  from  the  fact 
that  the  very  name  of  these  expeditions  in  Arabic 
is  "  Harka,"  "  the  burning."  No  matter  whether 
the  tribes  were  in  incipient  rebellion,  in  open 
revolt,  or  in  peace,  they  had  to  provide  the  food 
and  fodder  of  this  great  horde,  whose  ravages 
more  nearly  resembled  those  of  a  flight  of  locusts 
than  the  passing  by  of  human  beings.  Not  only 
such  "  legal "  taxation  as  could  be  extorted  was 
collected,  but  the  viziers  and  the  Sultan's  entour- 
age had  to  be  bribed  and  paid  as  well,  while 
every  soldier  and  every  camp-follower  pillaged  on 
his  own  account.  On  receiving  the  news  of  the 
coming  of  one  of  these  Imperial  expeditions,  as 
many  of  the  population  as  could,  or  as  dared, 
fled  to  other  regions  ;  and  the  Sultan  often  passed 
through  a  deserted  country,  except  that  the 
Governor  and  tribal  representatives  had  to  be 
there  to  pour  the  little  wealth  of  the  countryside 
into  the  royal  coffers. 

Morocco  was  still  an  almost  unknown  country 
in  those  days.  Europe  paid  little  attention  to 
what  was  passing  within  its  boundaries,  and  so 
long  as  the  Sultan's  actions  didn't  threaten  to 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  3 

complicate  international  questions,  he  was  allowed 
to  go  his  own  way.  The  rivalry  of  Great  Britain 
and  France  was  its  outstanding  feature,  together 
with  the  constantly  recurring  quarrels  and  petty 
local  wars  of  Spain  with  the  tribes  that  surround 
her  "  Presidios  "  on  the  northern  coast.  Morocco 
lived  its  life  apart.  True,  it  was  at  the  very  gates 
of  the  Mediterranean,  but  it  might  have  been  in 
the  Pacific  for  all  the  attention  that  it  attracted. 
From  time  to  time  the  European  Governments 
despatched  special  Missions  to  the  Sultan — gigantic 
picnics  to  one  or  other  of  the  capitals,  during 
which  the  pending  claims  would,  or  would  not, 
be  settled ;  a  commercial  treaty  was  possibly 
discussed ;  eternal  friendship  was  sworn  where 
only  hatred  on  one  side  and  indifference  on  the 
other  really  existed,  for  in  those  days  the  general 
feelings  of  the  Moors  toward  the  Europeans  and 
Christians  amounted  to  hate. 

Sir  William  Kirby-Green's  special  Mission  pro- 
ceeded by  sea  to  Mazagan,  conveyed  by  a  British 
warship,  and  thence  overland  to  Marrakesh,  the 
Sultan  having,  as  the  custom  was,  sent  an  escort, 
transport,  and  tents  to  the  coast  for  this 
purpose. 

However  rotten  the  state  of  Morocco  may  have 
been  at  that  time,  Mulai  Hassen's  strong  hand 
held  its  fabric  together,  and  presented  to  the 
outside  world  a  front  of  great  dignity.  The 
British  Mission  travelled  amongst  the  tribes  in 
perfect  security,  and  was  received  with  all  honour 
and  with  pretended  rejoicings.  Compliments 


4  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

flowed  as  fast  as  mountain  streams — happy  in 
their  wording,  sonorous  in  their  utterance,  and 
absolutely  insincere. 

And  then,  in  mingled  dust  and  sunshine,  the 
entry  into  the  southern  capital ;  the  threading 
of  its  narrow  streets ;  the  throng  of  onlookers  ; 
the  almost  hopeless  crush  of  horses  and  mules 
and  men ;  and  our  arrival  in  the  great  garden 
of  olives  and  oranges  which  surrounded  the  kiosks 
of  the  Maimounieh  Palace,  in  which  the  Mission 
was  housed  during  its  stay  at  Marrakesh. 

The  reception  of  foreign  envoys  by  the  Sultan 
formed  a  pageant  of  much  magnificence.  Only 
a  very  few  years  later  the  whole  formality  was 
changed,  and  the  representatives  of  the  Govern- 
ments of  Europe  were  no  longer  received  as  vassals 
bringing  tribute.  But  as  long  as  the  old  etiquette 
lasted,  there  could  be  no  question  about  the 
splendour  of  the  ceremony.  It  may  have  been 
derogatory,  and  no  doubt  was,  for  the  represen- 
tatives of  the  Great  Powers  of  Europe  to  stand 
bareheaded  in  the  sun  while  the  Sultan,  under  a 
crimson  parasol,  remained  on  horseback ;  but  no 
one  could  dispute  the  picturesqueness  of  the  scene 
or  its  oriental  dignity. 

The  great  square  of  the  palace,  covering  many 
acres,  in  which  the  reception  took  place,  was 
surrounded  by  yellow  walls,  here  and  there  pierced 
by  gateways.  At  one  end,  above  these  walls, 
appeared  the  flat  terraces  and  green-tiled  roofs  of 
the  palace,  at  the  other  extremity  the  cypress- 
and  olive-trees  of  the  great  park  of  the  Agdal ; 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  5 

while  away  to  the  south,  towering  high  into  the 
morning  sunlight,  rose  the  snow-covered  peaks  of 
the  Atlas  Mountains.  A  fitter  mise  en  scene  for 
a  great  pageant  could  scarcely  be  imagined. 

The  great  square  was  lined  with  troops,  ragged 
and  parti-coloured,  some  in  uniform  and  some 
out  of  it,  and  some  in  uniform  so  ragged  that 
they  were  as  much  out  of  it  as  in  it.  Others, 
again,  in  brilliant  costumes  of  every  colour,  evi- 
dently made  and  served  out  for  the  occasion. 
In  detail  much  was  wanting,  perhaps ;  in  general 
effect  it  was  a  rainbow.  Into  the  centre  of  this 
square  the  British  Minister  and  his  suite  were 
ushered  by  high  white-robed  functionaries  of  the 
Court,  while  close  behind  the  little  group  of 
uniformed  Europeans  were  piled  the  cases  of 
presents  sent  by  the  British  Government  to  His 
Shereefian  Majesty.  In  fact,  the  whole  traditional 
ceremony  was  based  upon  the  reception  of  vassals 
and  the  offering  of  tribute. 

A  blast  of  trumpets,  and  the  great  green  gates 
of  the  palace  are  hurled  open,  and  a  hurried 
throng  of  Court  attendants,  in  white  robes  and 
crimson-peaked  fezes,  emerges.  A  band  of  shrill 
music — pipes  and  drums — bursts  into  noise.  Ban- 
ners and  wand-bearers  and  spear-bearers  follow, 
and  black  grooms  leading  horses,  saddled  and 
caparisoned  in  gay  silks  and  gold  embroideries, 
which  prance  and  neigh  at  the  dust  and  noise. 
Then  the  Sultan,  a  stately  figure  in  white,  on  a 
white  horse  trapped  in  green  and  gold.  Over  his 
head  is  borne  the  great  flat  parasol  of  State,  of 


6  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

crimson  velvet  and  gold,  while  at  his  side  attend- 
ants wave  long  white  scarves  to  keep  the  flies 
off  his  sacred  person.  After  him  follow  his  viziers, 
portly  gentlemen  swathed  in  soft  white  hanging 
garments,  and  then  more  Court  attendants  and 
slaves. 

As  the  sacred  presence  of  the  Sultan  passes  into 
the  public  square  a  great  shout  rends  the  air, 
and  the  bowing  crowd  cries,  "  May  God  protect 
the  life  of  our  Lord." 

As  the  procession  approaches  the  group  of  the 
British  Mission  it  divides  to  right  and  left,  and 
the  Sultan  advances,  accompanied  only  by  his 
Chamberlain  and  one  or  two  attendants,  and 
followed  by  his  viziers.  The  members  of  the 
Mission  bow  and  salute,  and  the  Chamberlain 
presents  the  Minister  to  His  Majesty,  who  bids 
him  welcome.  Sir  William  Kirby-Green  then  read 
his  speech,  and  handed  his  credentials  to  His 
Majesty,  wrapped  up  in  silk.  The  Sultan  took 
them,  holding  the  folds  of  his  cloak  between  his 
sacred  fingers  and  the  infidel  documents  !  The 
suite  is  presented,  and  after  another  word  or  two 
of  welcome  on  the  part  of  the  Sultan,  His  Majesty 
turns  his  horse  and  retires  again  to  the  precincts 
of  his  palace,  amid  the  cries  of  his  people,  the 
booming  of  cannon,  and  the  shrill  blast  of  native 
music. 

It  may  not  be  out  of  place  to  give  here  a  brief 
account  of  how  this  ceremony  came  to  be  abolished. 
I  was  attached,  in  1902,  to  Sir  Arthur  Nicolson's 
special  Mission  to  the  Sultan  Mulai  Abdul  Aziz  at 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  7 

Rabat.  There  had  for  some  time  been  a  strong 
feeling  on  the  part  of  the  European  Governments 
that  some  new  ceremonial  should  replace  the 
traditional  form  of  the  reception  of  the  represen- 
tatives of  the  Powers,  and  I  was  sent  to  Rabat, 
a  week  in  advance  of  the  Mission,  to  urge  upon 
the  Sultan  the  expediency  of  this  change.  I  was 
at  that  time  upon  very  intimate  and  friendly 
terms  with  His  Majesty,  and  had  ample  oppor- 
tunity to  put  these  views  before  him.  Mulai 
Abdul  Aziz  always  had,  and  has,  the  true  instincts 
of  a  great  gentleman,  and  he  agreed  readily  that 
the  form  of  reception  in  vogue  at  his  Court  was 
derogatory  to  the  position  and  dignity  of  a  special 
envoy  from  the  Sovereign  and  Government  of 
Great  Britain.  At  the  same  time,  he  main- 
tained that  it  was  extremely  difficult  to  introduce 
radical  changes  in  Court  etiquette  without  creat- 
ing a  hostile  feeling  amongst  the  people,  or  at 
least  running  the  risk  of  much  criticism.  For 
a  few  days  he  hesitated ;  but  the  evening  before 
the  arrival  of  the  Mission  he  authorised  me  to 
inform  Sir  Arthur  Nicolson  that  the  old  cere- 
monial would  no  longer  be  carried  out,  and  that 
his  reception  would  take  place  in  a  room  in  the 
palace.  In  order  to  explain  the  change  of  pro- 
cedure, it  was  allowed  to  be  whispered  in  the 
town  that  His  Majesty  was  a  little  unwell,  and 
unable  to  stand  the  fatigue  of  the  great  function 
in  the  open  air. 

The  reception  accordingly  took  place  in  an  upper 
room  of  the  palace.    The  young  Sultan  was  seated 


8  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

cross-legged  on  a  pale  blue  Louis  XV.  sofa,  the 
greater  part  of  which  was  covered  by  his  out- 
spread robes.  At  his  side  stood  his  Minister  of 
Foreign  Affairs  and  his  viziers.  The  Chamberlain 
introduced  the  British  Minister,  who  read  his 
speech  in  English,  the  interpretation  being  made 
by  an  official  of  the  Legation.  The  Sultan  whis- 
pered his  reply  to  the  Foreign  Minister,  who  spoke 
it  out  aloud. 

The  scene  was  attractive,  and  of  course  much 
more  "  intimate "  than  the  great  ceremonial  of 
the  past,  but  was  never  lacking  in  dignity.  The 
"  audience,"  confined  strictly  to  the  reception, 
lasted  only  a  very  few  minutes,  when  the  Minister 
and  his  suite  retired.  As  we  were  proceeding 
down  the  staircase,  I  was  hurriedly  called  back 
into  the  Sultan's  presence.  He  had  thrown  ofT 
the  great  white  cloak  in  which  he  had  been  almost 
enveloped,  and  discarded  his  heavy  turban  of 
State  for  one  of  much  less  weighty  dimensions. 
His  viziers  and  courtiers  had  departed.  Calling 
to  me  to  come  quickly,  he  cried,  "  Climb  up  here 
with  me,  on  to  the  back  of  the  sofa ;  we  shall 
be  able  to  see  the  Mission  ride  out  of  the  palace 
square" ;  and  he  clambered  up  and  stood  on  the 
gilt  carving  of  his  throne,  whence,  by  pulling  him- 
self up  by  his  hands,  he  could  just  see  out  of  a 
little  window  high  up  in  the  richly-decorated  wall 
of  the  room.  Following  his  example,  I  mounted 
beside  him,  and  together  we  watched  the  Minister 
and  the  Mission  mount  their  horses  and  depart 
from  the  palace,  to  the  booming  of  guns. 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  9 

At  the  time  of  my  first  visit  to  the  Court,  Si 
Ahmed  ben  Moussa,  better  known  as  Bou  Ahmed, 
was  the  predominant  figure  amongst  the  native 
officials.  He  held  at  this  time  the  post  of  Cham- 
berlain, one  of  great  importance  and  influence, 
as  its  holder  was  in  constant  contact  with  the 
Sultan,  and  could  gain  his  private  ear.  He  was 
undoubtedly  devoted  to  the  Sultan's  interests,  and 
served  him  faithfully  and  well.  His  father  had 
been  a  palace  slave,  and  he  himself  was  very 
dark  in  colour,  and  of  most  unattractive  appear- 
ance. He  was  a  man  of  no  particular  intelligence, 
but  of  indomitable  will,  and  cruel.  He  made  no 
pretensions  to  understand  the  foreign  relations  of 
Morocco;  and  except  in  so  far  as  he  was  anti- 
European,  more  from  political  than  religious 
motives,  he  seems  to  have  had  no  fixed  policy. 
Even  later,  when  he  became,  under  Mulai  Abdul 
Aziz,  Grand  Vizier,  he  was  content  to  leave  the 
discussion  of  all  affairs  of  foreign  policy  to  the 
other  viziers,  though  no  doubt  he  took  part  in 
the  decisions  arrived  at.  Mulai  Hassen's  Foreign 
Minister  was  Sid  Fadhoul  Gharnit,  a  wily  and 
intelligent  gentleman,  who  is  still  living.  When 
the  Government  of  which  he  was  a  member  fell 
— and  the  falls  of  Government  in  those  days  often 
meant  the  falling  of  heads  too — Sid  Fadhoul 
Gharnit  was  seized  by  a  stroke,  and  disappeared 
into  the  recesses  of  his  house.  For  years  he  was 
supposed  to  be  paralysed,  and  was  no  doubt  in 
bad  health  ;  but  another  change  of  Ministry  came 
about  years  afterwards,  and  he  emerged  again, 


10  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

miraculously  cured  and  looking  younger  and  more 
xspry  than  ever,  to  become  Grand  Vizier  for  a  time. 
He  has  now  retired  from  public  life,  and  resides 
in  Fez.  No  doubt  his  paralysis,  real  or  feigned, 
saved  his  family  from  ruin,  his  fortune  from  con- 
fiscation, and  probably  himself  from  prison  or 
even  death.  Difficult  as  was  the  work,  great  as 
were  the  responsibilities  of  Cabinet  Ministers  in 
Morocco,  they  were  not  pestered  by  an  Opposi- 
tion, for  if — rarely — any  members  of  the  outgoing 
Government  survived,  they  were  always  in  prison. 

In  1893  Mulai  Hassen  determined  to  visit  the 
desert  regions  of  Morocco,  including  far-off  Tafilet, 
the  great  oasis  from  which  his  dynasty  had  origi- 
nally sprung,  and  where,  before  becoming  the  ruling 
branch  of  the  royal  family,  they  had  resided  ever 
since  their  founder,  the  great-grandson  of  the 
Prophet,  had  settled  there,  an  exile  from  the  East. 

Leaving  Fez  in  the  summer,  the  Sultan  pro- 
ceeded south,  crossing  the  Atlas  above  Kasba-el- 
Maghzen,  and  descended  to  the  upper  waters  of 
the  Wad  Ziz.  An  expedition  such  as  this  would 
have  required  a  system  of  organisation  far  in 
excess  of  the  capabilities  of  the  Moors,  great 
though  their  resources  were.  Food  was  lacking ; 
the  desert  regions  could  provide  little.  The  water 
was  bad,  the  heat  very  great.  Every  kind  of  delay, 
including  rebellion  and  the  consequent  punish- 
ment of  the  tribes,  hampered  the  Sultan's  move- 
ments ;  and  it  was  only  toward  winter  that  he 
arrived  in  Tafilet  with  a  fever-stricken  army  and 
greatly  diminished  transport.

THE  MOORISH  COURT  11 

Mulai  Hassen  returned  from  Tafilet  a  dying 
man.  The  internal  complaint  from  which  he  was 
suffering  had  become  acute  from  the  hardships  he 
had  undergone,  and  he  was  unable  to  obtain  the 
rest  that  his  state  of  health  required,  nor  would 
he  place  himself  under  a  regime.  For  a  few 
months  he  remained  in  the  southern  capital,  and 
in  the  late  spring  1894  set  out  to  suppress  a 
rebellion  that  had  broken  out  in  the  Tadla  region. 

While  camping  in  the  enemy  country  he  died. 
Now,  the  death  of  the  Sultan  under  such  circum- 
stances was  fraught  with  danger  to  the  State.  He 
was  an  absolute  monarch,  and  with  his  disappear- 
ance all  authority  and  government  lapsed  until 
his  successor  should  have  taken  up  the  reins. 
Again,  the  expedition  was  in  hostile  country,  and 
any  inkling  of  the  Sultan's  death  would  have 
brought  the  tribes  down  to  pillage  and  loot  the 
Imperial  camp.  As  long  as  the  Sultan  lived,  and\ 
was  present  with  his  expedition,  his  prestige  was 
sufficient  to  prevent  an  attack  of  the  tribes — 
though  even  this  was  not  unknown  on  one  or  two 
occasions — and  to  hold  his  forces  together  as  a 
sort  of  concrete  body.  But  his  death,  if  known, 
would  have  meant  speedy  disorganisation,  nor 
could  the  troops  themselves  be  trusted  not  to 
seize  this  opportunity  to  murder  and  loot. 

It  was  therefore  necessary  that  the  Sultan's 
demise  should  be  kept  an  absolute  secret.  He 
had  died  in  the  recesses  of  his  tents,  themselves 
enclosed  in  a  great  canvas  wall,  inside  which, 
except  on  very  special  occasions,  no  one  was 


12  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

permitted  to  penetrate.  The  knowledge  of  his 
death  was  therefore  limited  to  the  personal  slaves 
and  to  his  Chamberlain,  Bou  Ahmed. 

Orders  were  given  that  the  Sultan  would  start 
on  his  journey  at  dawn,  and  before  daylight  the 
State  palanquin  was  carried  into  the  Imperial 
enclosure,  the  corpse  laid  within  it,  and  its  doors 
closed  and  the  curtains  drawn.  At  the  first  pale 
break  of  dawn  the  palanquin  was  brought  out, 
supported  by  sturdy  mules.  Bugles  were  blown, 
the  band  played,  and  the  bowing  courtiers  and 
officials  poured  forth  their  stentorian  cry,  "  May 
God  protect  the  life  of  our  Lord."  The  procession 
formed  up,  and,  led  by  flying  banners,  the  dead 
Sultan  set  out  on  his  march. 

A  great  distance  was  covered  that  day.  Only 
once  did  the  procession  stop,  when  the  palanquin 
was  carried  into  a  tent  by  the  roadside,  that  the 
Sultan  might  breakfast.  Food  was  borne  in  and 
out ;  tea,  with  all  the  paraphernalia  of  its  brew- 
ing, was  served :  but  none  but  the  slaves  who  knew 
the  secret  were  permitted  to  enter.  The  Chamber- 
lain remained  with  the  corpse,  and  when  a  certain 
time  had  passed,  he  emerged  to  state  that  His 
Majesty  was  rested  and  had  breakfasted,  and 
would  proceed  on  his  journey — and  once  more 
the  procession  moved  on.  Another  long  march 
was  made  to  where  the  great  camp  was  pitched 
for  the  night. 

The  Sultan  was  tired,  the  Chamberlain  said. 
He  would  not  come  out  of  his  enclosure  to  trans- 
act business  as  usual  in  the  "  Diwan  "  tent,  where 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  13 

he  granted  audiences.  Documents  were  taken  in 
to  the  royal  quarters  by  the  Chamberlain  himself, 
and,  when  necessary,  they  emerged  bearing  the 
seal  of  State,  and  verbal  replies  were  given  to  a 
host  of  questions. 

Then  another  day  of  forced  marches,  for  the 
expedition  was  still  in  dangerous  country ;  but 
Mulai  Hassen's  death  could  no  longer  be  con- 
cealed. It  was  summer,  and  the  state  of  the 
Sultan's  body  told  its  own  secret. 

Bou  Ahmed  announced  that  His  Majesty  had 
died  two  days  before,  and  that  by  this  time  his 
young  son,  Mulai  Abdul  Aziz,  chosen  and  nomi- 
nated by  his  father,  had  been  proclaimed  at  Rabat, 
whither  the  fleetest  of  runners  had  been  sent  with 
the  news  immediately  after  the  death  had  occurred. 

It  was  a  fait  accompli.  The  army  was  now  free 
of  the  danger  of  being  attacked  by  the  tribes  ; 
and  the  knowledge  that  the  new  Sultan  was  already 
reigning,  and  that  tranquillity  existed  elsewhere, 
deterred  the  troops  from  any  excesses.  Many 
took  the  occasion  of  a  certain  disorganisation  to 
desert,  but  so  customary  was  this  practice  that  it 
attracted  little  or  no  attention. 

Two  days  later  the  body  of  the  dead  Sultan,  - 
now  in  a  terrible  state  of  decomposition,  arrived 
at  Rabat.  It  must  have  been  a  gruesome  pro- 
cession from  the  description  his  son  Mulai  Abdul 
Aziz  gave  me  :  the  hurried  arrival  of  the  swaying 
palanquin  bearing  its  terrible  burden,  five  days 
dead  in  the  great  heat  of  summer ;  the  escort, 
who  had  bound  scarves  over  their  faces — but  even 


16  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

dishes  of  cooked  meats,  or  what  was  left  of  them, 
had  been  removed,  there  remained  great  plates  of 
fresh  butter,  the  very  first  of  the  season,  hard 
and  rolled  into  large  balls.  The  learned  tutor  of 
the  Sultan's  sons  stated  that  it  was  much  to  be 
regretted  that  such  splendid  butter  should  be 
wasted  by  being  eaten  by  the  palace  slaves  and 
attendants,  and  forthwith  he  tore  off  a  length  of 
his  fine  white  turban,  rolled  up  one  of  the  large 
balls  of  butter,  and  replaced  the  package  in  the 
crown  of  his  high-peaked  fez,  which  formed  the 
foundation  of  his  headgear. 

One  of  the  slaves  told  Mulai  Hassen  what  had 
occurred,  and  he  determined  to  amuse  himself  at 
the  expense  of  his  sons'  tutor.  He  entered  the 
great  chamber  where  the  guests  were  assembled 
and  bade  them  welcome,  paying  a  few  compli- 
ments to  each.  When  it  came  to  the  turn  of  the 
learned  man,  the  Sultan  congratulated  him  on 
his  great  attainments,  adding,  "  He  shall  be  speci- 
ally honoured.  Bring  rose-water  and  incense." 

Now,  it  is  the  custom  at  Moorish  feasts  to 
sprinkle  the  guests  with  rose  and  orange-blossom 
water,  and  to  perfume  their  robes  with  incense. 
So  the  long-necked  silver  bottles  and  the  brass 
incense-burner  were  produced.  From  the  latter, 
laid  upon  red-hot  charcoal,  the  burning  sandal- 
wood  diffused  its  smoke  in  delicious  clouds. 
Having  received  the  regulation  sprinkling,  the 
incense-burner  was  placed  before  him.  Lifting 
his  wide  sleeves,  the  slaves  held  the  censer  below 
them,  allowing  the  smoke  to  permeate  his  volum- 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  17 

inous  garments.  Then  drawing  the  hood  of  his 
"  bernous  "  over  his  head  and  face,  the  customary 
perfuming  of  the  turban  was  begun.  But  the 
slaves  held  tight,  and  instead  of  the  performance 
lasting  half  a  minute,  it  was  unduly  prolonged. 
At  first  it  was  only  the  richly-perfumed  smoke  of 
the  sandalwood  that  entered  his  nose  and  eyes  ; 
but  presently  the  delicious  odour  changed,  for  the 
butter  concealed  in  his  fez,  melting  under  the 
applied  heat  of  the  red-hot  charcoal,  was  begin- 
ning to  drop  into  the  incense-burner,  giving  forth 
a  penetrating  and  unpleasant  odour  of  cooking. 
From  drops  to  a  trickling  stream  took  a  very 
little  while,  and  soon  the  whole  room  was  full  of 
the  smoke  of  burning  butter,  while  the  aged  scholar 
presented  the  most  pitiful  sight — half -blinded, 
choking,  and  dripping  all  over.  When  he  had 
been  washed  and  cleaned  up  the  Sultan  had 
gone. 

Mulai  Abdul  Aziz  was,  at  the  time  of  his  suc- 
cession (1894),  about  twelve  or  thirteen  years  of 
age.  He  was  a  younger  son  of  the  late  Sultan, 
for  Islamic  thrones  do  not  necessarily  descend  by 
primogeniture.  It  is  not  unseldom  a  brother  who 
succeeds,  and  at  times  even  more  distant  relations. 
The  throne  is  almost  elective  inside  the  royal 
family,  though,  as  a  matter  of  fact,  a  Sultan 
generally  nominates  his  successor.  The  descent 
from  the  common  ancestor — who  in  this  case  of 
Shereefian  families  is  the  Prophet  Mohammed — 
is  of  far  greater  importance  than  the  relationship 
of  the  deceased  and  succeeding  Sultan.  After  the 

B 


18  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

abdication  of  Mulai  Hafid  in  1912,  his  half-brother, 
Mulai  Youssef,  was  "chosen"  to  fill  the  throne, 
and  accepted  without  hesitation.  His  choice  has 
been  amply  justified  by  the  dignified  manner  and 
the  constant  tact  that  he  has  always  shown  in 
his  very  difficult  position. 

The  mother  of  Mulai  Abdul  Aziz  was  a  Turkish 
lady,  brought  from  Constantinople  to  Morocco. 
Report  states  that  she  was  a  woman  of  great 
intelligence  and  considerable  force  of  character. 
She  was  certainly  a  most  devoted  mother.  It  is 
even  said  that  she  played  a  part  in  the  politics 
of  the  country,  and  that  she  was  consulted  on 
affairs  of  State  by  her  husband.  That  she  must 
have  possessed  a  remarkable  personality  is  clear 
from  the  fact  that  she  maintained  her  influence 
over  the  Sultan  till  the  day  of  his  death — no  easy 
task  amidst  a  host  of  rivals — and  so  assured  the 
succession  of  her  son.  Her  great  friend  and  com- 
panion in  the  harem  was  another  Turkish  lady,, 
the  mother  of  the  reigning  Sultan  Mulai  Youssef. 
It  is  curious  that  these  two  "  strangers  in  a  foreign 
land  "  should  both  have  been  destined  to  become 
the  mothers  of  Sultans. 

It  was  only  natural  that  the  succession  of  a 
minor  gave  rise  to  every  form  of  intrigue  at  Court. 
There  were  two  great  factions  in  the  palace — the 
party  of  Bou  Ahmed,  the  powerful  Chamberlain, 
on  the  one  hand,  and  that  of  the  Grand  Vizier 
and  Minister  of  War  on  the  other.  These  two  high 
officials  belonged  to  the  aristocratic  and  powerful 
family  of  the  Ulad  Jamai,  and  were  respectively 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  19 

Haj  Amaati  and  Si  Mohammed  Soreir.  Now  Bou 
Ahmed  was  the  son  of  a  negro  slave,  and  there- 
fore could  count  on  no  tribal  or  family  influence. 
His  rivals,  on  the  contrary,  were  Fez  aristocrats, 
highly  born,  and  supported  by  the  influential 
population  of  the  towns.  They  came  of  what  is 
known  as  a  "  Maghzen  "  family — that  is  to  say, 
a  family  who  in  the  past  had  held  Government 
posts,  and  had  a  sort  of  traditional  claim  to  high 
employment.  It  was  evident  that  jealousy  must 
exist  between  these  two  factions. 

Bou  Ahmed's  position  of  Chamberlain  gave  him 
constant  access  to  his  sovereign,  whose  extreme 
youth  brought  him  little  into  contact  with  his 
viziers.  No  doubt,  too,  Bou  Ahmed  could  count 
upon  the  influence  of  the  Sultan's  mother.  He 
had  been  the  constant  and  trustworthy  confidant 
of  her  husband,  and  instrumental  in  putting  her 
son  on  the  throne.  His  own  fate,  too,  depended 
upon  his  keeping  him  there,  and  there  can  be 
little  doubt  that  Mulai  Abdul  Aziz's  mother  and 
Bou  Ahmed  worked  in  connivance. 

As  soon  as  the  new  Government  was  organised 
sufficiently  for  Mulai  Abdul  Aziz  to  travel,  the 
Court  left  Rabat  for  Fez — the  real  capital  of  the 
country.  No  Sultan  can  count  upon  his  throne 
as  being  safe  until  he  has  been  accepted  by  the 
religious  and  aristocratic  Fezzis,  and  taken  up  his 
residence  in  the  city;  for  Fez  is  the  centre  of 
religion  and  learning — and  also  of  intrigue — and 
the  influence  of  its  population  upon  the  tribes  is 
very  great.  It  was  therefore  very  important  that

the  influence  of  its  population  upon  the  tribes  is 
very  great.  It  was  therefore  very  important  that 


20  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

the  young  Sultan  should  reach  Fez  at  as  early 
a  date  as  possible.  His  journey  through  the  tribes 
to  Meknes  was  very  successful.  He  was  well 
received  on  every  side,  and  on  his  arrival  at  the 
old  capital  which  Mulai  Ismail,  a  contemporary 
of  Louis  Quatorze,  had  built,  the  population  of 
the  city  accorded  him  a  popular  welcome. 

Meknes  is  some  thirty-three  miles  from  Fez, 
and  there  remained  only  this  last  stage  of  the 
journey  to  be  accomplished. 

Bou  Ahmed  fully  appreciated  his  position.  He 
knew  that  once  in  Fez  his  influence  must  decrease. 
His  rivals  could  count  upon  the  support  not  only 
of  the  townspeople,  but  also  of  the  Sultan's  rela- 
tions in  the  capital.  To  the  Fezzis  he  was  an 
upstart,  and  there  would  be  no  peace  from  their 
intrigues  to  bring  about  his  fall,  and  no  pity  when 
he  fell.  It  was  a  case  of  now  or  never  for  Bou 
Ahmed. 

There  were  no  signs  of  the  coming  storm.  The 
Ulad  Jamai  brothers  were  no  doubt  waiting  till 
their  arrival  amongst  their  own  people  in  Fez  to 
begin  a  more  active  intrigue,  and  Bou  Ahmed 
himself  was  courteous  and  a  little  obsequious  to 
the  influential  viziers.  A  few  mornings  after  the 
Sultan's  arrival  at  Meknes,  the  usual  morning 
Court  was  being  held.  Haj  Amaati,  the  Grand 
Vizier,  surrounded  by  his  white-robed  followers, 
rode  into  the  palace  square,  amidst  the  bowing 
officials  and  the  salutes  of  troops.  He  was  imme- 
diately summoned  into  the  Sultan's  presence. 

Mulai  Abdul  Aziz  was  alone  with  Bou  Ahmed 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  21 

when  Haj  Amaati  entered.  He  prostrated  him- 
self, and  waited  for  the  Sultan  to  speak.  In  a 
rather  frightened  voice  Mulai  Abdul  Aziz  asked 
him  a  question.  Haj  Amaati' s  answer  was  not 
found  satisfactory,  and  Bou  Ahmed  burst  forth 
in  a  string  of  reproaches  against  the  Vizier,  and 
accused  him  of  disloyalty,  avarice,  extortion,  and 
political  crimes.  Suddenly  appealing  to  the  Sul- 
tan, he  asked  for  permission  to  arrest  him.  Mulai 
Abdul  Aziz  inclined  his  head. 

A  few  minutes  later  a  dishevelled,  cringing, 
crying  creature,  amid  jeers  and  laughter,  was 
dragged  through  the  palace  square  amongst  the 
crowd  that  only  so  short  a  time  before  had  been 
bowing  to  the  ground.  His  clothes  were  torn, 
for  the  soldiers  were  rough,  and  his  turban  was 
all  askew.  As  he  passed  through  the  gate,  dragged 
by  the  soldiery,  the  sentry  at  the  door  seized 
the  Vizier's  clean  white  turban  and  set  it  on  his 
own  head,  replacing  it  by  his  own  duty  fez  cap. 
A  shout  of  laughter  greeted  this  act. 

The  Vizier's  brother,  Si  Mohammed  Soreir,  the 
Minister  of  War,  had  not  yet  left  his  house  for 
the  palace.  He  was  arrested  at  his  own  doorway, 
and  did  not  attempt  to  resist,  but  allowed  himself 
to  be  led  to  prison. 

The  subsequent  history  of  these  two  men  forms 
perhaps  the  blackest  page  of  Mulai  Abdul  Aziz's 
reign.  They  were  sent  in  fetters  to  Tetuan,  and 
confined,  chained  and  fettered,  in  a  dungeon.  In 
the  course  of  time — and  how  long  those  ten  years 
must  have  been — Haj  Amaati  died.  The  Governor 


22  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

of  Tetuan  was  afraid  to  bury  the  body,  lest  he 
should  be  accused  of  having  allowed  his  prisoner 
to  escape.  He  wrote  to  Court  for  instructions. 
It  was  summer,  and  even  the  dungeon  was  hot. 
The  answer  did  not  come  for  eleven  days,  and  all 
that  time  Si  Mohammed  Soreir  remained  chained 
to  his  brother's  corpse  !  The  brother  survived. 
In  1908  he  was  released  after  fourteen  years' 
incarceration,  a  hopeless,  broken,  ruined  man. 
Everything  he  had  possessed  had  been  confis- 
cated ;  his  wives  and  children  had  died,  the  result 
of  want  and  persecution.  He  emerged  from  his 
dark  dungeon  nearly  blind,  and  lame  from  the 
cruel  fetters  he  had  worn.  In  his  days  of  power 
he  had  been  cruel,  it  is  said — but  what  a  price  he 
paid ! 

He  settled  in  Tangier,  where  I  saw  him  almost 
daily.  He  was  in  absolute  poverty ;  but  all  his 
friends  assisted  him — and  he  wanted  so  little.  An 
old  slave  woman  of  the  family,  who  had  survived 
in  some  out-of-the-way  corner,  came  to  look  after 
him,  and  used  to  massage  his  tortured  wrists  and 
ankles.  At  length  he  died. 

Two  days  before  his  death  I  saw  him  for  the 
last  time.  It  was  clear  that  a  very  little  span 
of  life  remained  for  him.  I  sat  with  him  a  long 
time,  and  as  I  rose  to  leave  him,  he  said  :  "  Listen. 
When  they  have  washed  my  body  for  burial,  I 
want  you  to  see  that  my  chains  and  fetters  are 
put  back  upon  my  limbs.  I  desire  to  appear 
before  my  God  as  I  spent  those  fourteen  years 
of  my  life,  that  I  may  appeal  to  Him  for  the 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  23 

justice  my  Sultan  refused  me,  that  He  in  His 
great  mercy  and  forgiveness  may  open  to  me  the 
gates  of  Paradise." 

It  was  impossible  to  replace  the  chains  and 
fetters,  but  I  believe  a  link  was  sewn  up  in  his 
winding-sheet.  With  the  cruellest  cynicism  he  was 
given  an  official  military  funeral,  attended  by  all 
the  native  authorities  and  functionaries — f or  after 
all  he  had  been  Minister  of  War  ! 

Sir  Ernest  Satow  represented  Great  Britain  in 
Morocco  at  the  time  of  Mulai  Abdul  Aziz's  succes- 
sion. On  learning  of  Mulai  Hassen's  death,  the 
news  of  which  Kaid  Maclean — who  was  with  the 
Moorish  army — had  managed  to  send  to  Tangier 
with  almost  incredible  rapidity,  Sir  Ernest  sent 
for  me  and  told  me  that  he  proposed  to  send 
some  confidential  agent  to  Fez  upon  a  mission, 
which  would  certainly  be  difficult  and  very  likely 
dangerous,  for,  as  the  news  of  the  Sultan's  death 
spread,  there  would  no  doubt  be  disturbances  on 
every  side.  I  naturally  volunteered  to  go,  and 
my  offer  was  accepted.  The  same  night  at  twelve 
o'clock  I  left,  accompanied  by  one  of  my  men, 
both  of  us  well  mounted  and  armed.  I  am  averse 
to  carrying  arms  in  such  countries  as  Morocco, 
and  have  very  seldom  done  so ;  but  the  occasion 
was  unusual,  and  bands  of  marauders  might  be 
looked  for.  I  was  dressed  as  a  native  mountaineer, 
my  head  shaved  except  for  one  long  lock  of  hair, 
which  I,  native  fashion,  wore  at  this  period  of 
my  life ;  my  legs  bare,  and  my  feet  thrust  into 
yellow  slippers.  A  rough  brown-hooded  cloak 


24  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

covered  my  scanty  clothing.  I,  no  doubt,  looked 
a  brigand — my  companion  was  one.  Luckily  I 
had  good  horses  in  my  stable,  and  we  chose  the 
two  most  likely  to  stand  the  fatigue.  It  was  most 
important  to  start  at  once  and  travel  fast,  in 
order,  if  possible,  to  keep  ahead  of  the  news  of 
the  Sultan's  death,  which  was  now  publicly  known 
in  Tangier.  I  could  not  take  the  direct  route  for 
Fez,  for  part  of  my  mission  was  to  visit  certain 
influential  Shereefs  en  route  to  whom  I  was  per- 
sonally known,  and  to  exhort  them  to  use  all 
their  influence  in  the  interests  of  peace,  law,  and 
order. 

It  was  midsummer,  and  dawn  was  early ;  but 
before  the  sun  had  risen  we  reached  Arzeila, 
twenty-six  miles  from  Tangier.  Here  I  break- 
fasted with  the  Shereef  of  Abrish,  a  brother-in- 
law  of  the  famous  Raisuli,  and  himself  a  man  of 
considerable  renown.  He  promised  to  exert  all 
his  influence  to  keep  the  tribes  quiet.  After  a 
short  halt  I  left  the  town,  and  at  night  arrived 
at  Alcazar,  having  covered,  by  the  route  we  had 
travelled,  well  over  sixty  miles.  From  Alcazar  to 
Wazzan  was  a  matter  of  some  eight  hours'  ride, 
and  I  reached  the  holy  city  of  that  name  early 
the  next  afternoon.  I  was  most  cordially  received 
by  the  very  influential  Shereefs  who  inhabit  that 
little  mountain  city,  so  rarely  visited  by  Euro- 
peans, as  it  is  holy  ground.  It  was  a  feast-day ; 
but  in  spite  of  that  the  Shereefs  at  once  got  to 
work,  sending  numerous  letters  to  the  tribes  to 
remain  quiet.  This  work  kept  me  at  Wazzan  till 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  25 

the  middle  of  the  following  day,  when  I  started 
once  more,  reaching  the  Maizerieh,  a  village  on 
the  hills  above  the  Sebou  Valley,  that  night. 
Here  we  slept,  to  start  again  before  daylight. 

It  was  clear  that  the  tribes  here  had  learned 
the  news  of  the  Sultan's  death,  for  all  night  long 
there  was  desultory  firing,  and  in  the  early  dawn 
we  could  distinguish  groups  of  horsemen  in  the 
valley  below.  A  general  wiping  out  of  old  scores 
had  begun,  combined  with  organised  pillage. 

Avoiding  as  far  as  possible  the  districts  where 
firing  was  taking  place,  my  man  and  I  rode  on. 
The  situation  was  uncomfortable,  and  I  forgot 
for  a  moment  what  brigands  we  ourselves  must 
have  looked ;  but  on  suddenly  coming  upon  a 
long  line  of  laden  camels,  the  half-dozen  caravan 
men  in  charge  took  to  their  heels  and  ran  for 
their  lives.  We  soon,  however,  reassured  them, 
and  rode  on.  The  fourth  day's  travelling  after 
leaving  Tangier  I  arrived  in  Fez,  having  by  our 
detours  covered  from  190  to  200  miles.  My  horses 
were  tired,  but  not  done  up.  At  midday  I  pre- 
sented the  British  Minister's  despatch,  and  my 
verbal  message,  to  a  council  of  the  native  authori- 
ties sitting  in  the  house  of  Amin  Haj  Abdesalam 
El-Mokri,  the  father  of  the  well-known  Grand 
Vizier,  Haj  Mohammed  El-Mokri,  perhaps  the 
most  intelligent  and  capable  of  all  the  Moorish 
authorities  of  to-day. 

I  remained  in  Fez  for  several  weeks.  Mean- 
while, Mulai  Abdul  Aziz  had  reached  Meknes, 
where,  at  the  moment  of  the  arrest  of  the  Grand 


26  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

Vizier  and  the  Minister  of  War,  I  arrived,  return- 
ing to  Fez  with  the  young  Sultan. 

I  have  always  looked  back  upon  that  period 
with  great  pleasure.  I  was  engaged  upon  a  mission 
of  some  delicacy,  and  I  was  thrust  into  the  very 
midst  of  native  affairs.  With  that  hospitality  for 
which  the  Mokri  family  is  so  well  known,  I  was 
a  guest  in  their  great  house,  one  of  the  sights  of 
Fez,  with  its  terraced  gardens  and  its  many  foun- 
tains. It  required  no  little  courage  in  those  days 
to  harbour  a  "  Christian,"  and  I  think  this  was 
the  first  time  on  which  a  European  had  ever 
been  made  welcome  to  stay  in  one  of  the  great 
Fez  houses.  I  wore  the  native  dress — I  had,  of 
course,  arrived  without  even  a  change  of  shirt — 
and  lived  in  the  company  of  the  sons  of  the  family, 
and  was  treated  as  one  of  them.  My  wants  were 
amply  supplied  from  the  voluminous  wardrobes  of 
my  hosts. 

My  mission  was  a  success.  On  14th  July  Sir 
Ernest  Satow  wrote  me  agreeing  to  my  request 
to  be  allowed  to  return  to  Tangier.  His  letter  is 
before  me  now  : — 

"  The  Foreign  Office  has  much  approved  of  my 
having  sent  you  to  Fez,  and  will  not  be  unmindful 
of  the  services  you  have  rendered  on  the  present 
occasion.  I  sent  copies  of  the  greater  part  of 
your  long  report  (which  I  copied  out  myself)  to 
Sanderson,  and  Lord  Kimberley  read  it  with  great 
interest.  I  will  only  add  now  that  I  feel  myself 
under  a  great  obligation  to  you  for  having  under- 
taken an  important  and,  to  all  appearances,  peril- 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  27 

ous  mission.  But  I  felt  you  were  the  man  to 
accomplish  it.  ...  Many  thanks  for  all  you  have 
done.  It  has  been  most  successful." 

My  mission  had  lasted  many  weeks,  and  necessi- 
tated riding  several  hundreds  of  miles  in  the  great 
heat  of  midsummer  in  discomfort,  and  often  in 
danger.  The  British  Government  remunerated  my 
services  by  presenting  me  with  a  cheque  of  £100. 
I  did  not  complain,  nor  do  I  now,  for  it  has  been 
so  unusual  to  be  paid  at  all  when  employed  upon 
these  unofficial  missions,  that  it  seemed  almost 
extravagant.  Only  on  one  other  occasion  during 
my  whole  Morocco  career  have  I  ever  been  paid 
even  my  out-of-pocket  expenses  for  tasks  under- 
taken at  the  request  of  the  British  authorities. 
I  never  realised  myself  the  extent  of  the  work 
I  have  done  in  this  connection  until  I  began  to 
write  this  book,  when  I  unearthed  the  voluminous 
correspondence  that  a  succession  of  British  Minis- 
ters had  addressed  to  me,  and  which  seem  to 
treat  of  every  mortal  question  pertaining  to 
Morocco. 

I  have  quoted  Sir  Ernest  Satow's  letter,  not 
from  any  desire  to  boast  of  the  utility  of  my 
work,  but  because  it  represented  one  of  the  very 
few  marks  of  appreciation  and  encouragement  that 
I  ever  received  from  official  sources,  or,  rather,  I 
should  perhaps  say,  in  which  the  credit  of  my 
work  was  allowed  to  me.  It  was  only  years  later 
that  I  learned  that  from  the  day  of  Sir  Ernest 
Satow's  departure  from  Morocco,  over  a  period 
of  many  years,  all  my  work  went  home  anony- 


28  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

mously — that  is  to  say,  contained  in  official  de- 
spatch as  "  I  understand,"  or  "  I  am  informed." 
In  my  own  particular  case  it  didn't  matter  much ; 
but  I  confess  that  it  hurt  a  little  to  be  told  long 
afterwards  that  the  mass  of  information  that  I 
obtained — often  by  undertaking  journeys  at  the 
direct  instigation  of  the  British  authorities,  often 
by  my  own  personal  relations  with  the  tribes,  and 
always  at  my  own  expense — went  home  without 
its  origin  being  disclosed,  and  without  identity. 
I  have  quoted  Sir  Ernest  Satow's  letter ;  I  will 
give  one  or  two  quotations  from  those  of  his 
successors. 

"  I  want  you  particularly  to  find  out  and  let 
me  know  the  following  things  .  .  ."  "It  would 
be  interesting,  as  you  are  in  that  part  of  the 
country,  if  you  would  go  a  little  farther  and 
visit  ..."  "I  want  you  to  impress  upon  the 
Sultan  the  importance  of  .  .  ."  "  I  would  like 
you  to  return  here  as  soon  as  possible,  to  consult 
you  about  the  .  .  .  question."  "  You  are  the 
only  authority  on  the  .  .  .  tribes  and  what  is 
passing  there.  Could  you  therefore  return  .  .  ." 
"  I  hope  you  will  arrange  not  to  be  long  away, 
as  I  want  to  consult  you  about  ..."  "  Please 
give  the  Sultan  clearly  to  understand  that  we  will 
not  .  .  ."  "  You  are  the  one  and  only  authority 
on  these  questions."  "When  you  have  time 
would  you  make  me  a  full  report  on  ..."  "As 
a  private  individual  it  will  be  easier  for  you  to 
get  the  Maghzen  [Government]  to  agree  to  .  .  ." 
"  I  bow  to  your  superior  knowledge  on  all  these 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  29 

questions,  and  now  agree  with  you  that  ..." 
"  Do  come  back.  I  am  lost  without  having  you 
to  consult."  These  are  a  few  extracts  of  what 
was  written  ;  the  verbal  instructions  and  requests 
were  naturally  far  greater. 

I  am  glad  of  having  been  able  to  be  of  use, 
and  would  not  hesitate  to  act  again  as  I  acted 
in  the  past ;  but  the  policy  of  depriving  the 
unofficial  and  unpaid  workman  of  the  little  crumbs 
of  credit  is  wrong.  It  ought  rather  to  be  the  rule 
to  tempt  young  men  of  adventurous  disposition 
to  live  the  life  I  led,  and,  if  necessary,  to  assist 
them — not  to  use  them  perpetually  and  keep  them 
outside  the  pale.  It  is  contrary  to  human  nature 
to  be  absolutely  disinterested  in  the  personal  suc- 
cess of  one's  work,  and  the  suppression  of  its 
origin — more  particularly  when  its  origin  is  a  life- 
time of  travel  and  of  study,  as  well  as  a  proficiency 
for  making  friends  amongst  such  people  as  the 
Moors — can  only  tend  toward  discouragement.  In 
any  branch  of  life  but  that  of  diplomacy  such 
action  would  be  considered  incorrect. 

Since  1912,  when  the  French  Protectorate  was 
declared,  and  even  before  that  date,  from  the 
time  when  England  had  abandoned  all  political 
aims  in  Morocco  except  to  assist  French  policy, 
my  information  became  of  more  value  to  the 
authorities  of  our  friend  and  ally  than  to  our- 
selves. I  was  invited  to  accompany  more  than 
one  French  special  Mission,  and  have  on  many 
occasions  been  consulted  on  questions  of  great 
confidence,  not  only  by  French  Ministers  in  Tan- 


30  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

gier,  but  also  by  the  highest  authorities  of  the 
French  Protectorate.  My  little  dossier  of  French 
official  correspondence  compares  very  favourably 
with  that  of  our  own  people.  Sir  Ernest  Satow's 
letter,  which  was  quoted,  is  the  one  and  only 
expression  of  appreciation  I  ever  received  from 
the  British  Government,  while  I  have  a  dozen 
letters  of  thanks,  simple  and  full  of  appreciation 
and  encouragement,  from  Paris.  My  duties  as 
'  Times  '  correspondent  often  brought  me  into  more 
or  less  acute  discussions  with  the  Spanish  Govern- 
ment, but  this  has  not  deterred  their  high  authori- 
ties from  expressing  to  me  on  several  occasions, 
in  letters  which  I  much  appreciate,  their  thanks 
for  information  given,  and  their  satisfaction  at  the 
large  and  fair  way  I  have  treated  certain  diplo- 
matic questions,  not  only  in  the  '  Times '  but  also 
elsewhere. 

In  such  a  life  as  I  have  led  there  have  been 
necessarily  moments  when  one  has  been  disheart- 
ened and  depressed,  perhaps  owing  to  fever,  per- 
haps to  events.  In  my  case,  happily,  they  have 
been  few  and  far  between,  and  I  look  back  over 
those  past  years  in  Morocco  as  a  period  of  great 
pleasure ;  but  there  have  been  moments  when  a 
little  word  of  encouragement,  a  few  lines  to  say 
that  one's  work  had  been  appreciated  at  home — 
another  letter,  for  instance,  like  Sir  Ernest  Satow's 
— would  have  been  so  welcome  and  have  done  so 
much.  I  can  honestly  say  the  occasions  have  not 
been  wanting. 

I  have  enjoyed  throughout  the  confidence  of 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  31 

our  representatives,  and  a  very  intimate  and  much 
appreciated  friendship  with  them  all.  I  have  had 
every  opportunity  of  seeing  the  inner  workings  of 
their  diplomacy,  and  I  can  state  that  Great 
Britain  has  been  fortunate  in  her  Ministers  in 
this  country.  Some  left  Tangier  to  fill  more 
important  posts  elsewhere — Sir  Ernest  Satow,  Sir 
Arthur  Nicolson,  and  the  late  Sir  Gerard  Lowther, 
the  best  and  kindest  of  men.  One,  perhaps  the 
most  brilliant  of  all,  rests  here  for  ever,  the  last 
British  Minister  to  Morocco,  Sir  Reginald  Lister, 
whose  loss  to  his  country  was  so  great,  and  to 
his  friends  irreparable. 


II. 

LIFE  AT   THE   MOORISH  COURT. 

MULAI  ABDUL  Aziz's  stay  in  Fez,  the  northern 
capital,  in  1894,  was  not  of  long  duration,  for  it 
was  important  that  the  Court  should  move  to  the 
south  to  consolidate  his  throne  in  those  regions. 
While  Northern  Morocco  has  always  been  the  un- 
restful  and  most  seditious  part  of  the  country,  it 
has  never  presented  such  a  serious  danger  as  the 
south  is  capable  of  becoming,  for  the  northern 
tribes  are  poor,  numerically  in  no  great  force,  and 
always  at  war  with  each  other.  But  in  the  Marra- 
kesh  region  it  is  different.  The  rich  agricultural 
land,  and  the  great  harvest  reaped  from  it,  render 
the  tribes  affluent ;  they  are  well  horsed  and  well 
armed,  and  very  prolific.  Again,  beyond  the 
plains,  the  great  range  of  the  Atlas  Mountains  is 
inhabited  by  spirited  and  warlike  Berber  tribes, 
to  all  intents  and  purposes  unconquered.  Fortun- 
ately for  the  welfare  of  a  long  succession  of  Moorish 
Sultans,  these  great  tribes,  governed  by  hereditary 
chiefs,  were  nearly  always  on  bad  .terms  with  one 
another ;  and  one  of  the  most  important  results 
accomplished  by  the  French  Protectorate  Govern- 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  33 

ment  in  the  last  few  years  has  been  to  form  a 
league  of  the  southern  tribesmen.  Any  one  who 
knew  the  old  Morocco  could  scarcely  believe  that 
the  great  chiefs — the  Glaoui,  the  Mtougi,  the  Gin- 
dafi,  and  the  Rahamna  Kaid — would  ever  join 
hands,  even  in  the  interests  of  the  country.  But 
to-day  it  is  so.  , 

Mulai  Abdul  Aziz  was  able  to  leave  the  north 
in  a  state  of  peace  and  security.  New  Governors 
had  been  appointed,  and  Bou  Ahmed's  firm  hand 
had  made  itself  felt,  and  it  was  indispensable  that 
the  Court  should  move  south :  there  were  already 
signs  of  unrest  that  could  not  be  ignored. 

The  arrival  of  the  Sultan  in  the  southern  capital 
had  a  tranquillising  effect,  and  Bou  Ahmed  set 
to  work  to  restore  order  amongst  the  restive 
tribes  and  to  build  himself  a  palace — at  the  public 
expense.  For  six  years  he  continued  building, 
and  every  available  workman  and  artist  was 
employed.  The  result  was  grandiose,  and  the 
building  now  forms  the  "  Residency "  of  the 
French  Protectorate  Government.  The  "  Bahya  " 
— that  is  to  say,  "  The  Effulgence,"  as  the  palace 
is  called — consists  of  a  succession  of  handsome 
courtyards,  one  planted  with  cypress,  orange, 
lemon,  and  other  fruit  trees  and  flowers,  lead- 
ing one  out  of  the  other.  These  courts  are 
surrounded  by  arcades,  on  to  which  the  great 
rooms  open.  Everywhere  are  fountains  and  tanks 
of  water.  This  palace  must  cover  many  acres  of 
land,  and  though  quite  modern,  is  a  building  of 
singular  interest.  There  is  one  courtyard  which 

c 


34  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

is  particularly  beautiful,  where  the  Moorish  archi- 
tect based  his  art  on  the  traditions  of  the  past. 
The  walls  are  higher ;  the  woodwork  is  not  painted, 
as  is  usual,  in  polychrome;  while  the  court  itself 
is  not  nearly  as  large  as  some  of  the  others.  The 
rooms  themselves  are  perhaps  less  interesting  than 
the  courtyards  into  which  they  open,  though  in 
many  cases  the  elaborately  carved  and  painted 
ceilings  are  very  good. 

On  a  very  recent  visit  to  Marrakesh  I  was  able 
to  wander  at  leisure  over  this  great  palace,  accom- 
panied by  a  native  who  was  in  charge,  and  who 
knew  its  every  corner  and  turret,  for  he  had  been 
employed  on  its  construction.  I  had  seen  it  years 
before — or,  rather,  a  portion  of  it — for  I  had  twice 
been  entertained  at  dinner  by  its  owner,  the  fam- 
ous Bou  Ahmed.  I  recall  now  one  of  those  even- 
ings :  the  hot,  jasmine-scented  air  of  the  courts, 
for  it  was  late  in  spring,  and  the  great  dinner 
served  in  one  of  the  saloons,  while  a  native  band 
discoursed  anything  but  soft  music  just  outside ; 
and  Bou  Ahmed  himself — short,  dark,  and  of 
unprepossessing  appearance,  but  none  the  less  an 
excellent  host.  He  has  been  dead  now  for  twenty 
years,  and  his  property,  confiscated  by  the  Sultan 
on  his  death,  has  passed  into  other  hands.  His 
name  is  only  a  memory  of  the  past.  In  Morocco 
it  was  not,  "  How  are  the  mighty  fallen  !  "  but 
"  How  are  the  mighty  falling  !  "  for  almost  month 
by  month  some  great  Kaid,  some  Vizier,  or  some 
Prince  fell — and  fell  far  indeed. 

Bou  Ahmed  had  other  things  to  think  of  besides 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  35 

his  house.  There  was  grave  dissatisfaction  amongst 
some  of  the  tribes,  particularly  amongst  the 
Rahamna,  whose  extensive  territory  lies  imme- 
diately to  the  north  of  the  city  of  Marrakesh. 
A  leader,  Taher  ben  Suleiman,  had  arisen,  and 
under  his  influence  the  tribes  revolted.  The  local 
authorities  were  murdered  or  driven  out,  and  the 
rebellion  became  general.  Its  suppression  took 
long,  and  cost  much  in  lives  and  money.  On  one 
occasion  the  rebels  arrived  at  the  walls  of  Marra- 
kesh and  took  possession  of  the  northern  suburbs 
of  the  town,  but  were  driven  back.  Bou  Ahmed 
showed  considerable  ability  in  the  suppression  of 
this  revolt :  not  only  was  his  energy  unceasing, 
but  he  knew  also  how  to  utilise  the  jealousy  and 
mistrust  that  always  exists  among  the  rebels.  He 
worked  tribe  against  tribe,  and  division  against 
division.  The  Maghzen,  by  its  superiority  of 
organisation,  and  by  the  means  at  its  disposal 
to  obtain  men,  arms,  and  ammunition,  prevailed. 
The  Rahamna  rebellion  was  repressed,  and  hun- 
dreds of  square  miles  of  country  were  given  up 
to  fire,  the  sword,  and  pillage.  The  tribe  was 
almost  wiped  out ;  hundreds  died  in  prison  ;  the 
women  and  children  became  the  prey  of  the 
soldiery,  and  were  sold  or  driven  away  to  starve, 
and  devastation  reigned  supreme.  A  few  years 
later  I  travelled  through  the  Rahamna  country. 
It  was  still  deserted,  and  the  fields  were  grown 
over  with  thick  weeds  and  thorn-bushes.  Only 
a  few  most  miserable  black  tents,  with  half -starved 
inhabitants,  remained  where  once  the  rich  and 


36  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

flourishing  Rahamna  tribe  had  dwelt.  Taher 
ben  Suleiman  was  captured.  He  was  imprisoned 
in  a  cage  made  of  the  barrels  of  his  partisans' 
rifles — a  cage  so  small  that  he  could  scarcely 
move  in  it, — and  was  exhibited  to  the  public 
of  Marrakesh,  to  be  spat  upon  and  reviled.  He 
died  in  prison. 

As  long  as  Bou  Ahmed  lived  the  young  Sultan 
remained  in  the  palace.  True,  he  appeared  at 
ceremonies  and  celebrated  the  religious  feasts  in 
public,  but  he  was  a  nonentity.  Bou  Ahmed  alone 
governed  Morocco. 

In  1900  he  died.  I  was  in  Marrakesh  at  the 
time  of  his  last  illness,  when  he  lingered  on  day 
by  day,  kept  alive  by  inhalations  of  oxygen.  No 
one  cared,  unless  it  was  a  few  of  his  personal 
followers  and  attendants,  who  would  naturally 
suffer  by  his  demise.  As  for  the  rest,  there  was  a 
general  indifference.  He  had  never  been  popular, 
and  the  immense  fortune  he  had  amassed  and 
great  palace  he  had  constructed  awoke  the  jealousy 
of  others  who  had  the  same  desires  but  not  the 
same  opportunities.  He  was  feared  certainly,  for 
his  will  was  indomitable,  and  he  was  cruel.  A 
sort  of  superstitious  reverence  had  encircled  his 
life,  but  it  disappeared  when  sickness  laid  him 
low ;  and  when  he  breathed  his  last,  the  pent-up 
feelings  of  the  people  burst  forth,  and  they  rose 
up  and  cursed  him. 

The  death  of  a  great  personage  in  Morocco  is 
terrible,  and  for  several  days  as  the  Vizier  lay 
expiring,  guards  were  stationed  outside  his  palace 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  37 

waiting  in  silence  for  the  end.  And  then  one 
morning  the  wail  of  the  women  within  the  house 
told  that  death  had  come.  Every  gateway  of  the 
great  building  was  seized,  and  no  one  was  allowed 
to  enter  or  come  out,  while  within  there  was 
pandemonium.  His  slaves  pillaged  wherever  they 
could  lay  their  hands.  His  women  fought  and 
stole  to  get  possession  of  the  jewels.  Safes  were 
broken  open,  documents  and  title-deeds  were  ex- 
tracted, precious  stones  were  torn  from  their  set- 
tings the  more  easily  to  be  concealed,  and  even 
murder  took  place. 

While  all  this  was  proceeding  within  the  strictly 
guarded  walls,  Bou  Ahmed's  body  was  borne  out 
and  buried.  The  Sultan,  weeping,  followed  the 
bier  of  the  man  who  had  put  him  on  his  throne 
and  kept  him  there  through  those  difficult  years 
of  his  youth.  He  must,  indeed,  have  felt  himself 
alone  as  he  stood  beside  the  grave  of  his  Vizier, 
who,  whatever  may  have  been  his  faults,  however 
great  may  have  been  his  extortions,  had  been 
loyal  throughout.  When  Mulai  Abdul  Aziz,  still 
weeping,  had  returned  to  his  palace,  his  first  act 
was  to  sign  the  decree  for  the  confiscation  of  all 
Bou  Ahmed's  property.  It  was  now  organised 
loot,  for  officials  and  slaves  were  turned  loose  to 
carry  out  the  royal  commands.  For  days  laden 
baggage  animals,  half -concealed  under  great  masses 
of  furniture,  heaped  with  carpets  and  bedding,  or 
staggering  under  safes,  bore  Bou  Ahmed's  pro- 
perty into  the  Sultan's  palace.  His  women  and 
his  slaves  were  made  to  give  up  their  loot,  and 


38  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

the  house  was  left  empty  and  its  owners  penni- 
less. A  few  days  later  nothing  remained  but  the 
great  building — all  the  rest  had  disappeared  into 
space.  His  family  were  driven  out  to  starvation 
and  ruin,  his  slaves  were  taken  by  the  Sultan  to 
be  kept  or  sold,  and  his  vast  properties  passed 
into  the  possession  of  the  State.  It  was  the 
custom  of  the  country.  The  belongings  of  all 
State  functionaries  passed  at  death  to  their  lord 
and  master  the  Sultan.  I  see  Bou  Ahmed's  sons 
now  and  again.  They  are  in  complete  poverty, 
and  accept  as  presents  with  real  gratitude  the 
little  sums  which  an  upper  servant  in  England 
would  despise. 

The  accepting  of  small  presents  of  money  is,  in 
Morocco,  not  considered  by  any  means  derogatory, 
much  less  the  accepting  of  large  sums.  I  remember 
well  a  great-uncle  of  the  reigning  Sultan,  a  man 
who  had  been  Viceroy  in  his  time,  who  regularly 
toured  the  country  with  a  slave  or  two,  collecting 
alms.  He  was  a  pleasant  genial  old  gentleman, 
and  had  no  hesitation  in  asking  any  one  he  met 
to  help  him,  or  in  accepting  the  smallest  of  coins. 
On  one  occasion  he  arrived  at  the  residence  of  a 
native  ex-official  of  the  Moorish  Court,  who  lived 
in  Tangier.  There  was  a  tennis-party  going  on, 
and  the  guests,  amongst  whom  were  a  certain 
number  of  the  representatives  of  the  European 
Powers,  were  at  tea.  His  Highness  called  me  aside 
and  asked  who  all  these  Europeans  were.  "  They 
are,"  I  replied,  "  largely  the  Ministers  of  the 
foreign  Powers."  "  Aha,"  said  the  Prince,  "  they 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  39 

ought  to  be  good  for  a  pair  of  shoes  if  not  for  a 
cloak.  Rich  people,  rich  people."  I  was  able  to 
deter  him,  much  to  his  surprise,  by  explaining 
that  it  was  not  the  custom  in  Europe  for  members 
of  the  royal  families  to  ask  total  strangers  for 
coats,  or  even  shoes,  and  I  added  that  if  he  would 
wait  a  little  I  would  see  what  could  be  done. 
I  mentioned  the  Prince's  request  to  a  few  of  my 
friends,  and  we  subscribed  between  us  the  six 
francs  necessary  to  purchase  a  pair  of  yellow 
slippers,  the  only  footgear  of  the  country.  He 
was  graciously  pleased  to  accept  them  with  the 
dignity  of  a  Prince  of  the  Blood. 

The  death  of  Bou  Ahmed  naturally  brought 
about  changes  at  Court.  Whatever  jealousies  there 
may  have  existed  amongst  the  viziers,  and  no 
doubt  they  were  many,  they  realised  that  common 
action  was  necessary.  Each  might  have,  and 
probably  would  have,  to  defend  his  own  particular 
position  from  the  others,  but  collectively  they  had 
to  defend  their  united  positions  from  all  the  world. 
They  must  either  succeed  or  fall  together,  and 
they  determined  to  succeed. 

The  Sultan  was  now  about  twenty  years  of  age, 
and  might  at  any  moment  desire  to  assert  himself ; 
and  the  self-assertion  of  young  monarchs  of  auto- 
cratic power  and  no  experience  is  dangerous.  The 
viziers  realised  that  in  all  probability  the  dis- 
appearance of  the  strong  hand  of  Bou  Ahmed 
would  tempt  the  young  Sultan  to  become  more 
independent,  and  it  was  necessary  to  come  to  some 
arrangement  as  to  how  he  should  be  led  to  think 


40  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

and  act.  Certainly  it  must  not  be  in  the  direc- 
tion of  affairs  of  State — those  the  viziers  meant 
to  keep  to  themselves.  An  occupation  must  be 
found  for  the  inexperienced  and  hitherto  secluded 
monarch. 

It  was  the  exact  reverse  of  all  the  traditions  of 
Morocco ;  but  the  situation  was  an  unusual  one, 
for  there  had  never  been  a  Sultan  in  a  similar 
position.  The  viziers  felt  that  should  influence 
be  brought  to  bear  to  keep  him  in  his  palace  he 
might  rebel  against  this  enforced  seclusion,  and 
rid  himself,  and  probably  in  no  gentle  manner, 
of  the  men  who  had  instituted  it.  No ;  it  was 
clear  the  Sultan  must  be  amused,  and  his  amuse- 
ments must  be  so  numerous  and  so  varied  that 
his  entire  attention  would  be  distracted  from 
affairs  of  State.  Morocco  itself  could  not  supply 
the  novelties  that  would  be  required.  Such  plea- 
sures and  such  luxuries  as  the  country  could 
produce  were  his  already — women,  horses,  jewels, 
and  the  whole  paraphernalia  that  goes  to  make 
up  an  oriental  potentate's  surroundings.  For 
further  distractions  appeal  must  be  made  to 
Europe.  It  was  not  made  in  vain.  It  was  the 
beginning  of  the  great  debacle,  of  the  reckless 
extravagance,  of  the  follies  and  the  debts  that  led 
to  foreign  loans,  and  step  by  step  to  the  loss  of 
Morocco's  independence. 

A  strong  and  good  adviser  might  have  prolonged 
the  life  of  an  independent  Morocco,  for  although 
possessed  of  no  great  attainments  or  will-power, 
Mulai  Abdul  Aziz  was  thoughtful,  intelligent,  and 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  41 

desirous  of  doing  well.  It  was  no  easy  matter, 
however,  at  Marrakesh,  the  southern  capital,  where 
the  Court  was  at  this  time  in  residence,  to  keep 
the  young  Sultan  amused.  Situated  100  miles 
from  the  nearest  port,  which  itself  was  300  miles 
down  the  Atlantic  coast,  communication  with 
Europe  was  necessarily  very  slow,  and  the  Sultan's 
ever-increasing  orders  of  European  goods  took  long 
to  carry  out.  Often,  too,  the  heavy  Atlantic  swell 
rendered  communication  impossible  between  the 
ships  and  the  shore  for  weeks  together. 

The  Sultan's  caterers  were  at  their  last  resources. v 
Fireworks  were  played  out ;  bicycle  tricks  had  led 
to  bruises  and  sprains ;  and  even  photography 
had  lost  its  pristine  interest.  At  this  critical 
moment  came  word  of  a  belated  circus  at  one  of 
the  coast  towns.  It  must  naturally  have  been  a 
very  poor  circus  ever  to  have  found  itself  at  that 
dreary  little  port,  but  its  advent  was  welcomed 
as  enthusiastically  as  if  it  had  been  Barnum's 
entire  show.  Imperial  letters  were  directed  to  the 
local  Kaids  and  Governors,  agents  rushed  wildly 
to  and  fro,  and  eventually  the  circus,  bag  and 
baggage,  consisting  of  a  dozen  people  and  three 
or  four  horses,  started  out  across  the  weary  plains 
of  Morocco  to  obey  the  royal  command.  It  all 
took  time,  and  meanwhile  in  Court  circles  it  was 
the  absorbing  topic  of  conversation.  One  or  two 
serious  rebellions  among  the  tribes,  and  an  acute 
quarrel  with  the  Government  of  a  European  Power, 
passed  into  temporary  oblivion. 

Now,   the   proprietress   of  this   circus   was   an 


42  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

extremely  stout  Spanish  lady  of  uncertain  age, 
on  whose  corpulent  body  the  rough  jogging  on  a 
mule  for  more  than  a  hundred  miles  had  left  almost 
as  painful  an  impression  as  the  discomfort,  heat, 
and  worry  of  the  journey  had  upon  her  temper. 
She  herself  took  no  active  part  in  the  perform- 
ance, and  it  was  on  this  account,  to  her  intense 
indignation  and  wrath,  that  she  was  refused  admit- 
tance to  the  court  of  the  palace  in  which  the 
Sultan  was  to  witness  the  show.  His  Majesty's 
orders  were  that  none  but  the  actual  performers 
should  be  allowed  to  enter. 

So  the  fat  lady  and  one  or  two  of  the  employees 
of  the  circus  remained  in  an  outer  courtyard 
adjoining  the  enclosure  in  which  the  Sultan,  seated 
under  a  gorgeous  tent,  was  witnessing  the  per- 
formance. A  wall  some  twenty  feet  in  height 
separated  these  two  courts ;  and  in  the  outer  one, 
where  the  fat  lady  found  herself,  the  Sultan  had 
been  building  some  additions  to  the  palace,  and 
a  pile  of  stone,  mortar,  and  other  material  reached 
almost  to  the  top  of  the  wall.  The  lady  was  both 
angry  and  bored,  nor  were  a  herd  of  gazelle  and 
a  few  fine  specimens  of  mouflon — Barbary  wild 
sheep — that  roamed  about  the  enclosure  sufficient 
to  keep  her  amused. 

To  have  received  a  royal  command  to  come  all 
that  way  to  the  Moorish  capital,  and  then  to  be 
deprived  of  the  glory  of  seeing  her  own  circus 
performing  before  a  real  Sultan,  was  more  than 
she  could  bear,  and  she  straightway  began  to 
climb  the  great  heap  of  building  material  that  lay 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  43 

piled  against  the  wall.  It  was  hard  work,  nor 
was  her  figure  suited  for  such  mountain-climbing  ; 
but  she  was  to  receive  assistance  from  a  source 
undreamed  of.  Affected,  no  doubt,  by  her  slow 
progress  in  a  sport  of  which  he  himself  was  so 
proficient,  the  old  ram  mouflon  lightly  bounded 
after  her.  Balancing  himself  for  a  moment  on 
his  hind-legs,  he  lunged  forward  and  butted  the 
fat  lady  so  successfully  from  below  that  her  ascent 
was  materially  assisted.  In  a  series  of  repeated 
bounds,  owing  to  no  voluntary  action  on  her  own 
part,  she  found  herself  pantingly  grasping  the  top 
of  the  thick  wall. 

Meanwhile  the  performance  of  the  circus  was 
progressing  to  the  Sultan's  satisfaction.  Suddenly, 
however,  an  expression  of  wrathful  consternation 
became  visible  in  his  face,  and,  speechless,  he 
pointed  at  the  wall.  There,  far  above,  was  the 
agonised  and  purple  visage  of  the  fat  lady,  peering 
down  at  the  Sultan  and  his  Court.  In  a  moment 
the  officers  of  the  suite  were  shouting  and  gesticu- 
lating to  her  to  retire.  But  the  only  reply  they 
received  was  a  sudden  vision  of  a  considerable 
portion  of  her  immense  body,  as  a  playful  mouflon, 
himself  invisible,  gave  her  another  hoist  up.  At 
last  all  her  body  was  on  the  wall,  to  which  she 
clung  for  dear  life  with  arms  and  legs,  as  she  lay 
extended  on  its  summit.  It  was  at  this  moment 
that  the  mouflon  appeared.  With  a  majestic 
bound  he  leaped  on  to  the  summit,  stood  for  a 
moment  poised  on  his  hind-legs,  then  suddenly 
dropped,  and  with  a  terrific  prod  from  his  wide 


44  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

horns,  butted  the  fat  lady  at  least  a  yard 
along  the  wall.  He  was  evidently  intent  upon 
taking  her  round  the  entire  circuit  of  the  court- 
yard. 

For  a  few  moments  there  was  turmoil.  The 
Sultan  sat  silent  and  amazed,  while  the  Cabinet 
Ministers  all  shouted  to  the  lady  to  disappear, 
which  she  was  certainly  most  anxious  to  do.  The 
slaves,  more  wisely,  pelted  the  mouflon  with  stones, 
and  drove  him  from  his  point  of  vantage.  Then 
slowly  the  lady  disappeared — the  fat  legs  first, 
then  the  heaving  mass  of  body,  and  finally  even 
vfche  purple  face  was  seen  no  more. 

It  was  in  1901  that  I  became  personally  ac- 
quainted with  the  young  Sultan.  I  had  seen 
him  once  or  twice,  for  I  had  accompanied  Sir 
Arthur  Nicolson's  special  Mission  to  Marrakesh  in 
1896  ;  but  at  that  time  the  Sultan  had  not  emerged 
from  his  shell  of  reserve.  He  was  still  a  young 
boy,  evidently  very  shy,  and  entirely  under  the 
thumb  of  Bou  Ahmed,  the  famous  Grand  Vizier. 
One  audience  that  we  had  with  him  on  that  occa- 
sion was  not  without  interest.  We  had  ridden 
far  into  the  depths  of  the  great  Agdal  gardens 
to  a  summer-house,  where  His  Shereefian  Majesty 
was  waiting  to  receive  the  British  Minister.  A 
tangled  jungle  of  orange-trees ;  vines  climbing 
over  broken  trellis,  and  clinging  in  festoons  to 
great  cypresses ;  here  and  there  a  broken  marble 
fountain  or  a  tiny  stream — such  were  our  sur- 
roundings. With  our  escort  of  white-robed  Moorish 
cavalry,  led  by  the  Master  of  the  Ceremonies,  we 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  45 

rode  through  the  great  garden  to  dismount  before 
a  kiosk  of  arches  and  pillars,  of  green-glazed 
tiles  and  red  geometric  frescoes  on  a  yellow  wall. 
Everywhere  the  tangle  of  vegetation  had  over- 
grown its  borders.  The  cypresses  shot  up,  pillars 
of  dark  green,  above  the  building,  while  vine, 
jasmine,  and  geranium  strove  for  the  supremacy 
below.  Outside  the  building,  and  out  of  sight  of  ' 
its  occupants,  sat  a  row  of  Moorish  officers,  the 
Sultan's  attendants.  At  the  door  of  the  one  room 
that  the  kiosk  contained  —  for  it  seemed  all 
arches  and  pillars  without — stood  Bou  Ahmed,  the 
Vizier,  a  dark,  stout,  short  man,  showing  his  black 
origin  in  every  feature. 

Within,  opposite  the  doorway,  on  a  Louis  Seize 
settee,  was  Mulai  Abdul  Aziz.  He  was  seated 
cross-legged,  with  his  hands  folded  in  his  lap  and 
half -hidden  in  his  soft  white  raiment.  I  remember 
being  particularly  struck  with  his  pale  complexion 
and  his  evident  shyness.  At  the  side  of  the  divan 
was  a  chair,  where  the  British  Minister  was  in- 
vited to  be  seated,  while  we  who  were  in  attend- 
ance stood  around  the  door.  The  Sultan  himself 
said  little,  and  that  little  was  addressed  to  his 
Vizier  in  almost  a  whisper,  and  repeated  by  him 
to  the  British  Minister.  In  a  few  minutes  Mulai 
Abdul  Aziz  had  largely  recovered  his  self-posses- 
sion, and  was  busy  taking  in  every  item  of  the 
uniforms  worn  by  the  Minister's  suite.  He  could 
scarcely  keep  his  eyes  off  one  man — the  present 
Lord  Loch — whose  six  feet  five,  capped  by  an 
enormous  busby,  was  of  evidently  entrancing  in- 


46  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

terest  to  His  Majesty.  Four  years  later,  talking 
to  Mulai  Abdul  Aziz  in  the  intimacy  of  personal 
friendship,  I  reminded  him  of  this  episode.  He 
laughingly  replied  that  he  had  certainly  been  more 
struck  with  his  height  and  uniform  than  anything 
else  on  that  Mission,  and  requested  me  to  ask  the 
British  Minister  whether  it  would  not  be  possible 
for  Lord  Loch  to  accompany  a  second  embassy 
that  was  to  start  a  few  months  later.  This  message 
duly  reached  the  authorities  at  home,  and  in 
January  1902  Mulai  Abdul  Aziz,  no  longer  shy, 
had  the  pleasure — and  it  was  an  evident  pleasure 
— of  once  more  welcoming  Lord  Loch  at  his  Court. 
I  little  thought  at  their  first  meeting,  when  I 
watched  the  young  Sultan's  shy  interest  in  the 
big  Guardsman,  that  a  few  years  later  I  should 
witness  the  same  Guardsman  instructing  the  same 
Sultan  in  the  mysteries  of  "  tip-and-run  "  in  an 
enclosure  of  the  Shereefian  Palace. 

My  first  private  audience  with  Mulai  Abdul  Aziz 
was  in  the  summer  of  1901.  After  a  considerable 
delay,  largely  owing  to  the  discussion  of  the  kind 
of  obeisance  I  was  prepared  to  make  in  entering 
His  Majesty's  presence,  I  was  honoured  with  a 
private  audience.  I  found  His  Majesty  courteous, 
pleasant,  and  intelligent.  He  was  easy  to  amuse, 
and  by  my  departure  from  the  austere  etiquette 
of  the  Court  in  not  confining  my  remarks  to 
replies  to  His  Majesty's  questions,  although  at  first 
it  seemed  a  little  to  surprise  him,  I  succeeded  in 
gaining  his  attention  and  amusement.  I  had  been 
told  that  my  audience  would  be  very  formal  and 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  47 

last  a  few  minutes.  It  lasted  over  an  hour.  The 
Sultan  was  seated,  and  I  remained  standing  the 
whole  time — to  which  I  could  not  very  well  object. 
In  any  case,  I  had  overcome  the  difficulty  of  my 
reception  by  refusing  point-blank  to  go  down  on 
my  knees  and  to  touch  the  floor  with  my  fore- 
head— a  form  of  salutation  which  was  being  prac- 
tised by  the  Europeans  in  His  Majesty's  service, 
for  already  he  had  begun  to  increase  his  Christian 
entourage.  I  had  stated  that  I  was  prepared  to 
enter  the  Sultan's  presence  in  adopting  the  same 
formalities  as  I  did  in  the  presence  of  my  own 
sovereign,  and  the  Sultan  had  accepted  that 
formula.  Almost  the  first  question  he  asked  me 
was  if  I  had  ever  been  received  in  private  audience 
by  my  own  King.  I  replied  that  I  had  experienced 
that  honour.  He  then  asked  what  obeisance  I 
had  made.  I  replied  that  I  had  bowed  on  enter- 
ing the  room,  and  again  on  approaching  His 
Majesty's  person.  The  Sultan  seemed  surprised, 
and  demanded  why  it  was  the  Englishmen  in  his 
service  carried  out  the  Moorish  form  of  etiquette 
by  kneeling  and  touching  the  floor  with  their 
foreheads  ?  I  could  only  protest  that  I  didn't 
know,  except  to  surmise  that,  as  they  were  in  the 
service  of  a  Moorish  Sultan,  they  probably  thought 
they  ought  to  adopt  the  traditional  Moorish  form 
of  obeisance.  The  Sultan  gave  orders  that  it  was 
to  be  discontinued,  though,  as  a  matter  of  fact, 
the  Europeans  in  his  service  still  continued  to  use 
it  on  the  great  feast-days  of  the  year  until  the 
end  of  his  reign.  A  few  years  later,  on  one  of 


48  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

these  occasions  I  saw  a  long  line  of  Englishmen 
drop  on  to  their  knees  and  bow  their  foreheads 
to  the  ground  as  the  Sultan  approached.  It  is  a 
matter  of  personal  option,  based  on  prejudice.  It 
seems  to  me  that  any  human  being  has  a  right 
to  act  in  such  matters  just  as  he  thinks  right. 
That  he  demeans  himself  or  his  country  by  so 
doing  appears  to  me  ridiculous.  An  Englishman, 
and  much  less  England,  cannot  be  demeaned  by 
any  fantastic  gymnastics.  I  preferred  not  to  do 
it  solely  for  the  reason  that  it  seemed  to  me  to 
be  absurd,  just  as  half  the  ceremonies  at  a  British 
coronation  would  appear  absurd  and  meaningless 
to  a  Moor.  Nearly  all  etiquette  is  ridiculous,  only 
we  are  more  or  less  accustomed  to  it,  and  have 
largely  modified  its  eccentricities.  I  have  experi- 
enced things  nearly  as  absurd  as  this  Moorish 
custom  in  other  Courts.  Some  years  ago,  on  one 
of  the  very  hottest  days  of  a  hot  summer  in  a 
country  of  Southern  Europe,  I  had  the  honour  to 
be  received  by  the  sovereign.  I  arrived  at  the 
palace  at  half-past  ten  in  the  morning  and  left  it 
at  one  o'clock.  The  king  in  question  was  dressed 
in  the  heavy  blue  uniform  of  an  admiral ;  I  was  in 
a  frock-coat.  The  thermometer,  even  in  the  room, 
must  have  been  in  or  very  near  the  nineties. 
Yet  we  stood  the  whole  time— for  two  hours  and 
a  half.  At  half-past  two  I  was  summoned  back 
to  the  palace  to  complete  this  long  but  interesting 
audience.  With  a  sigh  of  relief  His  Majesty  said, 
"  I  think  this  time  we  can  sit  down."  And  we 
did.  Why  on  earth  we  hadn't  sat  down  in  the 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  49 

morning  during  all  those  perspiring  hours  Heaven 
only  knows.  I  could  have  understood  a  king 
sitting  and  his  visitor  being  made  to  stand,  but 
mutual  discomfort  and  fatigue  in  such  a  case  and 
for  such  a  length  of  time  appears  to  me  to  be 
almost  childish  folly. 

The  Moorish  protocol  would  have  compared 
favourably  with  this  European  etiquette.  The 
Moorish  visitor  would  have  made  his  lowly  obei- 
sance to  the  sovereign,  but  this  done  he  would 
have  squatted  down,  more  or  less  comfortably, 
in  his  Sultan's  presence,  and  remained  seated  till 
the  end  of  the  audience.  It  seemed  to  me  to  be 
preferable.  But  etiquette  is  all  a  question  of 
custom  and  habit.  Take  kissing,  for  example. 
How  well  every  man  must  remember  how,  when  a 
small  boy,  he  feared  that  his  mother  might  kiss 
him  in  the  presence  of  his  schoolfellows.  In  after 
years,  when  it  is  too  late,  how  he  would  have 
treasured  those  lost  kisses  were  they  now  obtain- 
able !  What  amusement,  too,  the  kissing  of  foreign 
men  on  the  railway  platforms  of  the  continent 
has  caused  us !  But  witness  the  meeting  of  two 
great  Morocco  chiefs — the  stately  approach,  the 
last  few  more  hurried  steps,  and  the  graceful  em- 
brace as  each  bends  forward  and  kisses  the  other's 
shoulder.  I  have  seen  the  meeting  of  great  men 
in  Morocco  in  the  hour  of  sorrow,  when  they 
have  fallen  upon  each  other's  necks  and  wept. 
How  few  soldiers  know  that  the  origin  of  the 
salute  they  give  to-day  comes  from  the  East,  and 
is  really  no  more  than  the  movement  of  the  sub-

ject  to  shield  from  his  eyes  the  effulgent  glory  of 
his  sovereign,  only  to-day  it  applies  equally  to 
the  effulgent  glory  of  his  second  lieutenant  as  well. 
Habit  is  everything,  and  prejudice  scarcely  less. 

These  were  the  first  days  of  the  toys  and  fire- 
works at  the  Moorish  Court.  For  a  time  the 
t  latter  were  paramount,  and  almost  nightly  the 
southern  capital  was  illumined  by  the  reflection 
of  Catherine-wheels  and  startled  by  the  flashing 
of  the  many  colours  of  marvellous  rockets.  A  man 
was  brought  especially  from  England  to  show  and 
prepare  the  fireworks,  and  he  became  a  permanent 
member  of  His  Majesty's  suite.  The  natives  were 
partly  amused,  partly  shocked.  Thrifty  as  the 
Moor  is  by  nature,  he  could  not  overlook  the 
wild  extravagance  of  this  manner  of  spending 
money,  and  the  fireworks  by  the  time  they  had 
arrived  in  Marrakesh  had  cost  a  pretty  price. 
Freight,  insurance,  and  the  long  caravan  trans- 
port from  the  cost  had  to  be  added  to  the  original 
cost,  and  there  was  an  item  known  as  commission. 
They  were  certainly  very  beautiful  fireworks  and 
very  expensive.  I  was  present  at  a  display  given 
to  amuse  a  British  Minister,  who  highly  dis- 
approved of  this  extravagance,  but  could  not 
refuse  the  invitation.  There  was  a  set  piece  of 
an  enormous  elephant,  and  the  show  concluded 
with  a  waterfall  of  fire  in  a  new  shade  of  pink, 
just  discovered,  and  accordingly  of  elevated  price. 
It  was  certainly  very  beautiful,  but  it  was  very 
useless  and  very  dear. 

One   afternoon  the   Sultan   informed   me   that 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  51 

there  would  be  a  display  that  night  in  the  palace 
grounds,  but  that  it  was  for  the  "  palace  " — that 
was  to  say,  the  ladies — and  no  men  would  be 
invited ;  but  if  I  went  up  on  to  the  roof  of  the 
house  in  which  I  was  living,  I  should  no  doubt 
be  able  to  witness  something  of  it.  I  watched 
the  beautiful  rockets  of  every  colour  rise  in  their 
streaks  of  fire  into  the  wonderful  sapphire  blue 
of  the  sky  of  the  southern  night,  to  burst  with 
their  thousand  stars,  filling  the  whole  scene  of  the 
flat  house-tops  of  the  old  city  with  the  pale  glow 
of  greens  and  pinks  and  yellows.  In  the  "  Jumma 
el-Fenaa  " — the  open  place  that  lies  in  the  centre 
of  the  city — the  crowds  stood  and  watched  the 
rockets  as  they  rose  over  the  high  walls  of  the 
palace  half  a  mile  away. 

The  next  day  the  Sultan  asked  me  what  I  had 
thought  of  the  display.  I  spoke  of  its  beauty,  and 
hinted  at  its  waste.  I  mentioned  the  crowd  in 
the  square.  "  What  did  the  people  say  ?  "  asked 
the  Sultan.  "  I  didn't  hear  much,"  I  replied ; 
"  but  on  several  occasions  some  one  would  cry 
out,  '  There  goes  another  thousand  dollars  of  our 
money.' 3 

Mulai  Abdul  Aziz  had  expected  to  hear  his  own 
praises  sung  for  having  presented  the  brilliant 
spectacle  to  the  people  of  his  city,  and  my  answer 
surprised  him.  It  was,  however,  not  without 
effect,  or  perhaps  he  was  growing  tired  of  coloured 
fires,  for  there  was  a  great  diminution  in  these 
displays,  although  the  professional  exhibitor  re- 
mained for  some  time  later  at  the  palace. 


52  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

Throughout  the  many  months  that  I  spent  at 
the  Moorish  Court,  I  always  felt  that  a  catastrophe 
must  eventually  happen.  The  Sultan  was  evidently 
being  led  upon  the  road  to  ruin,  and  near  him  as 
I  was,  all  my  efforts  to  persuade  him  of  the  fact 
were  in  vain.  On  more  than  one  occasion,  par- 
ticularly towards  the  end  of  1902,  I  implored  him, 
in  language  which  he  smilingly  told  me  no  one 
had  ever  ventured  to  address  to  him  before,  to 
pull  himself  up  in  time.  He  was  kind,  thanked 
me  for  being  so  outspoken,  and  continued  his 
pro-European  proclivities  and  his  extravagances. 
Had  he  at  that  time  dismissed  the  greater  number 
of  his  European  employees,  leaving  only  his  doctor, 
an  engineer  or  two,  and  any  one  who  had  been 
in  his  father's  employ,  and  ceased  spending  his 
money,  the  whole  future  of  Morocco  might  have 
been  changed. 

His  afternoons  in  Marrakesh  were  given  up  to 
play.  More  than  once,  always  accompanied  by 
Menebhi,  the  Minister  of  War,  and  some  of  his 
European  employees,  we  rode  in  the  immense 
wilderness  of  gardens  of  the  Agdal  Palace.  At  the 
edge  of  a  great  square  tank  we  would  dismount, 
and  sometimes  went  for  a  row  in  one  of  the  various 
boats  that  he  kept  there.  On  one  occasion  His 
Majesty  and  his  Minister  rowed — very  badly  in- 
deed— while  I,  the  only  other  occupant  of  the 
boat,  steered.  The  Sultan,  who  rowed  bow,  caught 
several  crabs,  and  splashed  poor  Menebhi  all  over. 
The  Minister  of  War  rowed  about  one  hundred 
short  strokes  to  the  minute,  whilst  the  Sultan, 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  53 

struggling  with  his  oars,  rowed  about  ten  extremely 
long  ones.  But  both  were  hugely  delighted  with 
the  performance,  and  our  spirits  were  of  the 
highest. 

"  We  are  both  boatmen,  and  you  are  the  pas- 
senger. We  are  crossing  a  Moorish  ferry,"  cried 
the  Sultan. 

Entering  into  the  Sultan's  little  joke,  I  replied 
"  that  they  were  the  worst  ferrymen  I  had  ever 
seen,  and  that  on  landing  I  should  complain  to 
the  authorities  of  their  incapacity." 

"  Oh,  you  will,  will  you  ?  "  replied  Mulai  Abdul 
Aziz.  "  Then  all  I  can  say  is,  we  won't  put  you 
ashore  until  you  pay  us." 

"  Then  I'll  stop  here." 

"  All  right,"  replied  the  Sultan  ;  and  he  promptly 
began  to  splash  me  with  all  his  might  and  main, 
though  poor  Menebhi  was  getting  as  wet  as  I  was. 

"  Will  you  pay  ?  "  asked  His  Majesty. 

"  Willingly,"  I  laughed.    "  How  much  ?  " 

"  Half  a  peseta  each "  (about  4d.),  answered 
the  Sultan,  and  they  duly  pocketed  their  fee. 
It  was  the  first  time  in  my  life  I  had  tipped  a 
Sultan  and  a  Minister  of  War. 

In  the  autumn  of  1902  I  was  invited  to  accom- 
pany the  royal  progress  to  the  northern  capital, 
Fez. 

The  Sultan's  departure  from  Marrakesh,  where 
he  had  now  been  in  residence  for  some  six  years, 
had  been  expected  earlier  in  the  autumn  ;  but 
constant  delays  occurred,  and  although  the  im- 
perial tents  had  been  for  some  time  pitched  out- 


54  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

side  the  city  gates,  it  was  not  until  late  in  November 
that  a  start  was  made.  Early  one  morning,  sur- 
rounded by  all  the  characteristic  pomp  pertaining 
to  the  Sultanate  of  Morocco,  Mulai  Abdul  Aziz 
left  his  palace  in  the  southern  capital  for  the  first 
camp  of  his  northward  march. 

There  is  no  necessity  to  describe  day  by  day 
the  Sultan's  progress.  The  etiquette  and  formali- 
ties of  each  were  almost  identical,  though  the  scene 
was  an  ever- varying  one,  changing  with  the  nature 
of  the  country  traversed.  An  account  of  one  day, 
picked  out  at  hazard,  will  be  sufficient  to  give 
an  idea  of  the  whole.  Long  before  daylight  the 
great  camp  was  astir,  and  when,  soon  after  3  A.M., 
the  morning  gun  was  fired,  a  number  of  tents 
had  already  been  struck,  horses  saddled,  and  mules 
and  camels  packed  for  the  march.  In  the  moon- 
light and  early  dawn  the  scene  was  one  of  great 
beauty — an  indistinct  medley  of  white  tents,  here 
silvery  in  the  moonlight,  there  ruddy  with  the 
glow  of  camp-fires,  whose  tall  red  columns  of 
smoke  rose  pillar-like  into  the  still  air.  In  and 
about  the  tents  passed  the  shadowy  forms  of  men 
and  animals.  As  if  by  magic  the  scene  was  ever 
changing,  as  tent  after  tent  silently  fell  to  the 
ground,  until  with  the  first  glow  of  dawn  there 
remained  of  the  great  encampment  only  the  canvas- 
walled  enclosure  containing  the  Sultan's  tents,  and 
a  plain  covered  with  horsemen  and  thousands 
upon  thousands  of  baggage  mules  and  camels. 
Already  the  cavalry  were  massed  near  the  Sultan's 
enclosure,  the  horsemen  forming  an  open  square, 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  55 

in  the  centre  of  which,  surrounded  by  the  Ministers 
of  State,  lay  a  crimson-curtained  palanquin  with 
its  couch  of  turquoise  blue.  From  the  entrance  of 
the  Sultan's  tents  to  the  square  of  cavalry  a 
double  line  was  formed  by  white-robed,  red-capped 
officials,  awaiting  His  Majesty. 

A  bugle  sounds  clear  in  the  still  atmosphere, 
and  a  moment  later  a  great  cry  rends  the  air. 
There  is  a  beating  of  drums  and  a  sound  of  trum- 
pets, as  a  solitary  white  figure,  erect  and  dignified, 
walks  slowly  through  the  bowing  lines  of  officials, 
enters  the  square  of  horsemen,  and  seats  himself 
upon  the  blue  divan.  Again  arises  the  cry  of  wel- 
come, as,  bending  forward,  the  tribes  greet  their 
Sultan  with  the  salutation,  "  May  God  prolong 
the  life  of  our  Lord." 

The  sun  has  risen  now,  his  first  rays  falling  upon 
the  gold-orbed  banners,  heavy  with  brocades  and 
silks  that  wave  high  above  the  heads  of  the 
cavalry ;  then  upon  the  wild  horsemen  themselves, 
their  saddles  of  brilliant  reds  and  greens,  half- 
hidden  in  the  heavy  folds  of  their  long  white 
garments,  and  the  scene  becomes  one  of  indescrib- 
able beauty.  One  by  one  the  Sultan's  tents  are 
struck,  and  the  great  canvas-walled  enclosure 
vanishes  under  the  hands  of  hundreds  of  skilled 
tent-pitchers.  Sometimes  His  Majesty  gives  an 
audience  to  an  official,  a  local  governor  of  a  tribe, 
who,  barefoot,  approaches  the  Sultan,  falls  upon 
his  knees,  and  three  times  touches  the  ground 
with  his  forehead,  remaining  crouched  before 
his  lord  and  master  during  the  few  seconds  that 


56  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

such  audiences  last.  Again  a  bugle ;  and  through 
the  line  of  horsemen  run  dusky  soldiers  leading 
saddled  horses,  trotting  them  past  the  Sultan 
that  he  may  choose  upon  the  back  of  which 
he  will  perform  the  day's  march.  With  a  slight 
motion  of  his  hand  the  choice  is  made,  and  the 
honoured  steed  is  led  up  to  the  palanquin.  Some- 
times it  is  a  white,  saddled  and  trapped  in  tur- 
quoise blue ;  sometimes  a  grey,  decked  in  rose- 
coloured  silks ;  sometimes  a  black,  his  head  half 
hidden  in  primrose-yellow  tassels. 

As  the  Sultan  mounts,  the  scene  becomes  for  a 
few  minutes  one  of  wild  confusion.  The  banner- 
bearers,  the  spear-bearers,  the  cavalry,  the  scarlet- 
and-blue  mounted  infantry,  the  high  officials  on 
their  saddle-mules,  the  artillery,  even  the  Sultan 
himself,  seems  hopelessly  mixed  in  a  struggling 
crowd.  It  is  only  for  a  very  little  while,  and  then 
from  the  medley  emerges  the  royal  procession, 
forming  into  order  as  it  proceeds.  The  vanguard 
is  formed  of  an  escort  of  cavalry,  headed  by  the 
standard-bearers,  carrying  flags  of  every  hue  and 
colour,  the  poles  topped  with  glittering  balls. 
Next  come  the  artillery,  the  guns  carried  upon 
the  backs  of  mules,  and  after  them  a  troop  of 
mounted  infantry.  Two  mounted  men,  carrying 
long  slender  spears,  precede  the  led  horses,  five 
or  six  of  which,  trapped  in  rich  silks,  always  form 
a  feature  of  the  procession.  Riding  alone  is  the 
Grand  Master  of  the  Ceremonies,  a  dark  man  of 
fine  presence,  wand  of  office  in  hand.  Then,  after 
a  space  of  some  forty  yards,  the  Sultan,  a  solitary 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  57 

white  figure  on  horseback.  At  his  side  run  negroes, 
waving  long  white  scarves  to  keep  the  dust  and 
the  flies  off  his  holy  person.  Immediately  behind 
His  Majesty  rides  a  soldier,  bearing  aloft,  so  as 
to  shade  the  Sultan  from  the  rays  of  the  sun, 
the  Imperial  parasol  of  crimson  and  gold.  The 
red  palanquin,  borne  by  sturdy  mules,  follows, 
and  behind  it  a  long  wide  line  of  standard-bearers, 
the  banners  rich  in  gold  thread  and  brocaded 
silks,  and  the  poles  of  one  and  all  crowned  with 
gilded  orbs.  Immediately  behind  the  flags  ride 
the  viziers  and  great  officers  of  State,  followed  by 
a  rabble  of  smaller  officials  and  soldiery,  of  black 
slaves  and  tribesmen  from  all  over  Morocco. 

There  are  no  roads,  and  the  procession  of  men 
and  animals  spreads  widely  out  over  the  plains 
and  undulating  hills.  Often  as  far  as  the  eye  can 
reach  one  can  trace  the  great  migration  stretching 
from  horizon  to  horizon,  a  rainbow  of  colour  upon 
the  green  plains.  Sometimes  to  cross  a  valley  the 
procession  narrows  in,  to  spread  out  again  in  the 
open  country  beyond,  till  the  whole  land  is  dotted 
with  horsemen  and  mules,  and  slow-gaited  lumber- 
ing camels. 

Now  and  again  a  tribal  governor,  with  his  escort 
of  horsemen,  comes  to  sahite  his  sovereign.  Drawn 
up  in  a  long  line  they  await  the  Sultan's  approach. 
At  his  approach  the  governor  dismounts  from  his 
horse  and  prostrates  himself  before  his  lord,  to 
rise  again  at  a  signal  from  His  Majesty.  Bending 
low,  he  approaches  and  kisses  the  Sultan's  stirrup, 
then  mounts  again,  and  with  a  hoarse  cry  of 


58  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

welcome  the  tribesmen  dig  their  spurs  into  the 
flanks  of  their  barbs  and  gallop  pell-mell  hither 
and  thither,  now  singly,  now  in  line,  firing  their 
guns  the  while,  until  the  horses  are  brought  to 
a  sudden  standstill  in  a  cloud  of  smoke  and  dust. 
These  tribesmen  are  not  the  only  people  who 
come  from  afar  to  greet  the  Sultan  on  his  march. 
There  are  beggars  and  representatives  of  all  the 
dervish  sects,  from  cymbal-beating  negroes  from 
the  Sudan  to  the  Hamacha  of  Meknes,  who  cut 
open  their  heads  with  hatchets.  There  are  snake- 
charmers  and  acrobats,  and  men  with  performing 
apes ;  little  deputations  of  country  Jews  and 
Jewesses ;  groups  of  white-robed  scholars  from 
local  mosques,  bearing  white  flags ;  veiled  Arab 
women,  uttering  shrill  trembling  cries  of  welcome, 
and  offering  bowls  of  milk ;  lepers  with  their 
faces  swathed  and  wearing  great  straw  hats,  bear- 
ing bowls  of  wood  to  collect  alms  in,  for  none  may 
touch  them — a  thousand  scenes  of  human  life, 
with  all  its  pleasures  and  all  its  tragedies. 

On  the  sixth  day's  march  one  of  the  largest 
rivers  in  Morocco,  the  Oum  er-Rebia,  had  to  be 
forded.  Fortunately  the  autumn  rains  had  not 
yet  fallen,  and  the  river  presented  no  great  obstacle 
to  the  passage  of  so  large  a  caravan.  Almost  the 
first  to  ride  across  was  the  Sultan,  his  horse  sur- 
rounded by  negroes  on  foot,  while  a  line  of  expert 
swimmers  were  held  in  readiness,  linked  hand  in 
hand,  stretched  from  bank  to  bank.  For  over 
three  hours  the  procession  steadily  waded  through, 
and  though  many  a  mule  fell  and  many  a  man 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  59 

and  pack  were  soaked,  no  serious  accidents  oc- 
curred. It  was  a  scene  of  wild  confusion  as  the 
horsemen  and  laden  animals  climbed  down  the 
steep  bank  to  the  water's  edge  and  entered  the 
swiftly-flowing  river ;  but  in  the  end  all  got  across 
in  safety,  and  great  were  the  rejoicings  and  many 
the  congratulations  that  night  in  camp,  for  it  is 
seldom  that  a  Sultan  and  his  vast  following  have 
crossed  the  Oum  er-Rebia  without  paying  a  toll  in 
human  lives. 

Usually  a  ride  about  four  hours  brings  the 
Sultan  to  his  next  camping-ground.  A  quarter 
of  an  hour  before  reaching  the  selected  spot  the 
bands  commence  to  play,  and  the  tribesmen,  the 
cavalry,  and  mounted  infantry  gallop  ahead,  form- 
ing into  two  lines,  between  which  His  Majesty 
rides  into  a  square  of  horsemen  drawn  up  in  the 
same  formation  as  that  of  the  early  morning. 
The  crimson  palanquin  is  quickly  unharnessed,  the 
blue  divan  arranged,  and  Mulai  Abdul  Aziz  seats 
himself  in  solitary  state  to  await  the  pitching  of 
his  encampment. 

No  tent  might  be  raised  in  the  camp  until  the 
gilded  globe  which  surmounts  the  Sultan's  prin- 
cipal tent  is  in  position ;  but  it  required  only  a 
very  short  time  for  the  skilled  tent-pitchers  to 
pitch  the  great  mass  of  canvas  crowned  with  its 
glittering  orb.  It  is  a  signal  to  the  rest  of  the 
camp,  and  almost  as  if  growing  from  the  ground 
arose  the  white  canvas  town.  There  was  no  con- 
fusion, no  noise.  Every  one  knew  the  right  posi- 
tion to  pitch  in,  and  the  whole  system  worked 


60  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

without  a  hitch.  Probably  the  Moors  are  alone 
in  the  pitching  of  these  great  camps ;  it  seems  a 
hereditary  trait  in  their  characters.  Sultan  after 
Sultan,  ever  since  the  Empire  of  Morocco  first 
came  under  the  dominion  of  the  Arabs,  had 
travelled  in  exactly  the  same  manner  as  that  in 
which  Mulai  Abdul  Aziz  was  making  the  journey 
from  Marrakesh  to  Rabat.  In  no  detail  had  it 
changed.  The  very  shape  and  decoration  of  the 
tents  had  never  varied,  and  to  such  an  extent 
had  conservatism  been  maintained,  the  Sultan 
told  the  writer,  that,  so  far  from  travelling  with 
all  the  luxury  that  one  could  imagine,  he  was 
forbidden  by  the  unwritten  laws  of  tradition  to 
cover  the  floor  of  his  State  tent,  except  for  three 
small  carpets.  The  rest  of  the  floor-space  must 
consist  of  the  soil  of  the  country,  and  this,  on  the 
day  which  His  Majesty  narrated  the  fact,  was 
perhaps  four  inches  deep  in  almost  liquid  black 
mud.  Outside  his  tent  he  may  lay  down  straw  or 
matting,  or  any  covering  he  may  please,  but 
within  there  must  be  nothing. 

The  Sultan's  principal  tent  once  up,  the  tent- 
pitchers  turned  their  attention  to  the  remainder 
of  his  camp,  consisting  of  some  half-dozen  large 
marquees,  the  whole — an  acre  perhaps  of  ground 
— being  enclosed  with  a  nine-feet  wall  of  white 
canvas,  decorated  in  patterns  of  dark  blue.  This 
private  encampment  of  His  Majesty  formed  the 
centre  of  the  camp,  which  stretched  away  on  all 
sides,  often  for  nearly  half  a  mile  in  every  direc- 
tion. At  the  outer  extremity  were  pitched  the 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  61 

tents  of  the  infantry,  so  close  to  one  another  that 
entrance  and  exit  to  the  camp  was  only  possible 
at  certain  intervals,  where  spaces  were  left  for  the 
purpose. 

The  greatest  interest  naturally  attached  to  the 
immediate  surroundings  of  the  Sultan's  tents.  No 
one  but  his  ladies  and  their  female  slaves  might 
enter  the  walled  enclosure,  with  the  exception  of 
one  small  portion  of  it  divided  off  from  the  rest, 
retained  for  unofficial  audiences.  His  Majesty 
transacted  all  his  affairs  of  State  outside  the  en- 
closure, in  a  tent  of  scarlet  and  green  cloth,  pitched 
at  the  end  of  a  large  open  square,  and  visible  from 
a  considerable  distance.  Here  before  the  eyes  of 
the  public  His  Majesty  received  his  Ministers, 
attended  to  his  correspondence,  and  sealed  official 
documents.  Near  this  tent,  known  as  the  "  Si  wan," 
were  two  large  marquees,  one  used  as  a  mosque, 
the  other  the  office  of  the  viziers.  In  this  quarter, 
too,  were  the  offices  of  the  other  Ministers  of  State 
and  high  officials.  Behind  these  were  the  private 
encampments  of  the  more  important  personages, 
often  consisting  of  several  very  large  tents  leading 
to  one  another  by  covered  passages  of  canvas. 
Directly  opposite,  on  the  farther  side  of  the  Sultan's 
enclosure,  were  the  royal  stables,  where  a  quantity 
of  fine  barbs  were  tethered,  their  number  con- 
stantly being  added  to  by  the  presents  brought 
to  His  Majesty  by  the  tribal  governors. 

As  soon  as  his  tents  were  ready,  the  Sultan 
remounted  his  horse,  and  amidst  the  playing  of 
bands  and  the  shouts  of  the  tribesmen,  rode  into 


62  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

the  seclusion  of  his  private  camp.  It  was  generally 
not  long  after  His  Majesty's  disappearance  from 
view  that  a  long  line  of  white-robed  and  veiled 
women,  mounted  upon  mules,  passed  silently 
amongst  the  tents  and  entered  the  royal  precincts. 
As  they  filed  through  the  camp  every  man  turned 
his  head  away  from  the  mysterious  white  pro- 
cession. Usually  the  whole  camp  was  pitched  by 
midday,  and  not  long  after  that  hour  the  neigh- 
bourhood of  the  Government  quarters  became  astir 
with  life.  The  white-robed  viziers  sought  their 
offices,  while  soldiers  kept  order  amongst  the 
throng  of  people  that  were  always  crowding  near 
the  tent  doors  awaiting  audiences  with  the  Minis- 
ters of  State.  Only  the  "  Siwan  "  was  deserted, 
but  not  for  long.  A  bugle  sounds.  There  is  a 
hurrying  to  and  fro  of  officials  and  soldiers,  and 
again  the  cry,  "  God  prolong  the  life  of  our  Lord," 
is  heard,  and  the  solitary  white  figure,  round 
whom  all  this  great  camp  revolves,  is  seen  slowly 
entering  under  the  shadow  of  the  tent  of  scarlet 
and  green. 

His  Majesty  usually  gave  some  two  or  three 
hours  a  day  to  the  consideration  of  affairs  of  State, 
though,  on  the  occasions  on  which  the  great  cara- 
van did  not  travel  and  no  journey  was  made,  a 
considerably  longer  period  was  put  aside  for  public 
business.  Meanwhile,  in  another  quarter  of  the 
camp,  provisions  and  fodder  were  being  distri- 
buted to  the  vast  concourse  of  people  who  follow 
His  Majesty  upon  these  royal  progresses.  Yet,  in 
spite  of  the  fact  that  some  thirty  thousand  persons 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  63 

and  probably  twenty  thousand  horses  and  mules 
had  to  be  fed,  the  commissariat  worked  without 
a  hitch,  and  food  and  fodder  were  supplied  in  an 
incredibly  short  period  of  time  to  all  those  who 
had  a  right  to  receive  it.  The  local  tribes  alone 
were  dependent  upon  their  own  resources,  and, 
with  this  exception,  the  Sultan  feeds  the  whole 
camp.  Up  till  the  time  of  this  journey  of  Mulai 
Abdul  Aziz  the  march  of  a  Sultan  through  a  dis- 
trict was  sufficient  to  bring  ruin  upon  the  people, 
so  extortionate  were  the  demands  made  upon 
them.  But  he  would  have  none  of  this,  and 
most  of  the  provisioning  was  paid  for,  not  by 
local  taxation,  but  from  the  Imperial  Treasury, 
and  His  Majesty  showed  throughout  solicitude  for 
the  welfare  of  his  subjects.  He  allowed  them  to 
approach  him,  and  listened  attentively  to  their 
complaints  against  the  local  officials. 

At  sunset  gunfire,  His  Majesty  prayed,  and 
retired  to  his  tents  for  the  night,  though  almost 
every  evening  he  gave  unofficial  audiences  to  his 
friends  in  the  divided-off  portion  of  his  private 
encampment  reserved  for  this  purpose.  As  night 
fell  the  camp  became  dotted  with  the  little  lights 
of  lanterns,  often  gaily  decorated  with  coloured 
glass,  while  here  and  there  a  camp-fire  showed  up 
ruddily  amongst  the  tents.  Now  and  again  could 
be  heard  the  tinkling  of  stringed  instruments  and 
the  soft  murmur  of  a  singer,  who  seemed  afraid  to 
raise  his  voice  in  the  stillness  that  pervades  every- 
thing,— a  stillness  only  broken  now  and  again  by 
an  order  to  the  guards  and  sentries — of  whom

400,  shoulder  to  shoulder,  encircled  the  Sultan's 
enclosure — or  by  the  long-drawn  accents  of  the 
mueddin  as  he  called  the  Faithful  to  prayer. 

The  "  last  post " — and  as  the  note  of  the  bugle 
dies  away,  a  wonderful  silence  fell  upon  the  moon- 
lit camp. 


III. 

THE  ROAD    TO   RUIN. 

BY  the  end  of  1902  Mulai  Abdul  Aziz  had  returned 
to  Fez,  desirous  of  introducing  reforms,  and  reck- 
lessly extravagant.  His  intentions  were  the  best ; 
but  if  there  was  one  thing  his  viziers  did  not 
desire  to  see  introduced  it  was  reform,  for  their 
livelihoods  and  their  fortunes  depended  upon  a 
continuance  of  the  state  of  corruption  which  they 
had  every  interest  to  see  prolonged.  So  they 
closed  their  eyes  to  the  young  Sultan's  extrava- 
gances, watched  him  waste  his  own  and  his  coun- 
try's money  on  every  sort  of  folly,  and  shared  in 
the  profits. 

All  sorts  of  rumours  and  stories  were  current 
amongst  the  tribes  as  to  what  went  on  in  the 
palace.  For  instance,  the  Sultan,  finding  the  white 
walls  of  one  of  the  interior  courtyards  too  dazzling 
for  his  eyes,  had  them  painted  blue — an  innova- 
tion unheard  of  at  a  Court  where  tradition  ruled. 
Now  the  walls  of  this  courtyard  were  visible  from 
the  hills  above  Fez,  and  the  patch  of  bright  blue 
soon  attracted  the  attention  of  the  tribesmen 
attending  the  local  markets.  To  them,  as  it  was 

E 


66  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

contrary  to  Moslem  tradition,  it  must  be  of  Chris- 
tian origin,  and  a  story  was  soon  being  circulated 
that  Mulai  Abdul  Aziz  had  lost  his  fortune  playing 
cards  with  his  Christian  friends,  and  was  now 
staking  the  various  parts  of  his  palace  in  lieu  of 
money.  He  had  lost  this  particular  court,  which 
the  Christians  had  taken  possession  of  and  painted 
blue.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  at  this  period  playing- 
cards  were  unknown  inside  the  palace,  and  with 
all  his  extravagances  Mulai  Abdul  Aziz  never 
showed  the  least  propensity  to  gambling.  All  play 
for  money  is  forbidden  by  the  Moslem  religion, 
and  the  young  Sultan  was  strict  in  the  observances 
of  his  faith. 

The  rumours  of  Christian  influence  spread  fast, 
and  were  soon  taken  advantage  of.  The  Moors 
are  essentially  opportunists,  and  one,  Omar  ez- 
Zarhonni,  was  more  opportunist  than  the  rest. 
He  was  an  educated  man  who  had  been  a  scribe 
at  Court,  but  a  forgery  had  put  an  end  to  his 
career  in  the  precincts  of  the  palace.  For  a  time 
he  was  a  sort  of  secretary  to  Hammou  el-Hassen, 
the  Berber  Kaid  of  the  Beni  Mtir  tribe,  when  I 
knew  him.  In  1901  he  left  the  Kaid  and  dis- 
appeared into  the  country.  Amongst  other  useful 
attainments  he  was  a  skilful  forger,  and  knew  a 
certain  number  of  rather  ordinary  conjuring  tricks. 
He  possessed  as  well  a  most  fluent  tongue.  By 
the  aid  of  these  accomplishments  he  was  able  to 
make  a  living,  travelling  from  tribe  to  tribe  on 
a  she-donkey,  from  which  fact  he  became  known 
along  the  countryside  as  "  Bou  Hamara  " — liter- 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  67 

ally,  the  "Father  of  the  she-donkey."  It  was 
amongst  the  simple  tribesmen  of  the  Rif  that  he 
met  with  his  principal  success.  Starting  with  the 
idea  of  merely  earning  a  livelihood,  he  soon  saw 
the  possibilities  of  a  career  on  a  larger  scale.  His 
conjuring  tricks,  his  wily  tongue,  and  his  forgeries 
— to  say  nothing  of  the  she-donkey — encircled  him 
with  a  sort  of  religious  prestige ;  and  one  day  he 
suddenly  declared  himself  to  be  Mulai  Mohamed, 
the  first-born  son  of  the  late  Sultan  Mulai  Hassen, 
and  therefore  the  elder  brother  of  the  then  reigning 
sovereign,  Mulai  Abdul  Aziz.  For  a  time  he  did 
not  discard  his  donkey,  and  the  humility  of  this 
means  of  transit  added  attractions  to  his  prestige 
in  the  eyes  of  the  devout. 

In  the  late  autumn  of  1902  Mulai  Abdul  Aziz 
left  Fez  for  Rabat.  His  departure  had  been  de- 
layed on  account  of  this  incipient  rebellion  of  Bou 
Hamara's  ;  but  affairs  seemed  to  have  quieted 
down,  and  the  departure  of  the  Court  took  place 
in  November.  An  army  had  been  meanwhile  sent 
in  the  direction  of  Taza  to  put  down  the  rebellion. 
The  choice  of  a  Commander-in-Chief  for  this  army 
was  typical  of  Morocco  of  those  days.  The  situa- 
tion was  critical,  and  the  future  depended  largely 
upon  the  success  of  His  Majesty's  troops.  The 
Sultan  was  leaving  North  Morocco,  and  by  this 
fact  alone  his  position  would  be  weakened ;  but 
the  tradition  of  corruption — accepted  and  per- 
mitted— was  too  great.  I  asked  the  Sultan,  for 
I  was  at  Fez  with  him  at  that  time,  whom  he 
had  chosen  as  Commander-in-Chief.  To  my  aston- 


68  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

ishment  he  replied,  "  My  brother,  Mulai  el-Kebir." 
"  But  he  is  still  a  boy,"  I  replied,  "  and  has  never 
been  a  soldier."  "  True,"  replied  the  Sultan,  "  but 
my  other  brothers  have  all  commanded  expedi- 
tions. It  is  Mulai  el-Kebir's  turn.  He  has  never 
had  a  chance  of  making  a  little  money."  The 
making  of  a  little  money  was,  of  course,  the 
abstraction  of  the  soldiers'  pay  and  extortion 
everywhere.  I  accompanied  the  Sultan  when  he 
left  Fez  in  November.  The  Court  proceeded,  with 
all  its  pomp  and  majesty,  to  Meknes,  where  we 
stayed  a  few  days,  and  then  on  into  the  Zimmour 
country,  where  rebellion  was  rife.  It  is  impossible 
to  say  of  how  many  people  the  rabble  which 
accompanied  the  Sultan  consisted,  but  we  were 
probably  18,000  or  20,000  in  camp,  with  at  least 
half  perfectly  useless  for  warfare.  A  number  of 
Fez  merchants,  who  followed  the  Court  from 
capital  to  capital,  accompanied  the  Sultan,  and 
each  had  his  family  and  retainers  with  him. 
Amongst  other  strange  groups  were  hundreds  of 
beggars,  for  the  most  part  blind,  who  also  migrated 
with  the  Court. 

There  was  some  fighting  in  the  Zimmour  country, 
but  still  more  in  the  Sultan's  camp.  The  incidents 
which  occurred  were  typical  of  the  time  and 
country.  The  Zimmour  tribesmen  decided  to  re- 
sist the  Sultan's  progress  at  a  deep  ravine  which 
crossed  the  plains  at  right  angles  to  our  line  of 
march.  This  ravine  was  perhaps  400  feet  in  depth, 
a  few  yards  wide  only  at  the  bottom,  where  a 
little  river  flowed,  and  half  a  mile  across  at  its 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  69 

summit.  Aware  that  the  army  was  likely  to  meet 
with  resistance  at  this  spot,  a  halt  was  called  on 
the  edge  of  the  valley.  Half-way  up  the  steep 
slope  on  the  opposite  side  was  an  open  ledge  of 
green  grass,  on  which  was  a  group  of  black  tents 
and  thatch  huts  of  the  Zimmour  villagers.  From 
the  thick  brushwood  opposite  a  few  rebel  shots 
were  fired  at  the  army.  The  Sultan's  artillery  and 
machine-guns  were  brought  up  to  the  edge  of  the 
ravine,  and  began  firing  promiscuously  into  the 
brushwood.  It  was  soon  clear  that  the  valley 
was  not  strongly  held.  The  Zimmour  tribesmen 
are  horsemen,  and  their  attack  was  more  likely 
to  be  made  on  the  plain  across  the  ravine,  at  the 
moment  when  the  army  was  extricating  itself  from 
the  precipices  and  brushwood. 

A  regiment — the  Doukkalas — was  ordered  to 
clear  the  valley  in  preparation  for  an  advance, 
and  started  down  the  steep  hillside  with  much 
noise  and  singing.  A  few  shots  were  fired  at  them 
as  they  descended.  The  river  crossed,  they  began 
the  ascent,  and  soon  reached  the  little  deserted 
village.  Here  temptation  was  too  strong,  and 
instead  of  mounting  higher  they  began  to  loot. 
The  villagers  had  carried  off  all  their  movable 
property,  but  their  stores  of  grain  remained,  and 
grain  is  valuable  in  the  Sultan's  camp.  The  ques- 
tion was  how  to  transport  it.  The  Moorish  soldier 
is  not  easily  foiled,  and  the  brave  Doukkala  regi- 
ment was  quite  up  to  the  occasion.  In  the  presence 
of  the  Sultan  and  of  the  whole  army  they  laid 
down  their  rifles,  took  off  their  baggy  uniform 


70  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

breeches  of  bright  blue  cotton,  tied  up  the  holes 
through  which  the  legs  ordinarily  protruded  with 
string,  and  filled  the  rest  with  wheat.  This  done, 
they  loaded  up  their  booty  on  their  backs,  picked 
up  their  rifles,  and  started  to  return  to  the  army. 

Nothing  would  make  them  go  on :  bugles  were 
blown,  signals  made,  orders  shouted ;  but  the 
Doukkalas  felt  that  their  day's  work  was  done, 
and  steadily  climbed  homewards.  In  exasperation 
the  Abda  regiment,  equally  famous  and  equally 
brave,  was  sent  to  support  them,  and  to  see  if 
they  couldn't  be  persuaded  to  turn  once  more  in 
the  direction  of  the  enemy  and  abandon  their 
loot. 

With  music  and  singing  the  Abda  regiment  set 
out.  They  met  the  Doukkalas  struggling  up  under 
their  heavy  loads  near  the  river-bed.  A  collision 
was  inevitable,  and  the  Abda  charged.  The  Douk- 
kalas threw  down  their  loads  and  commenced 
firing,  and  in  a  few  minutes  a  little  battle  was 
raging  far  down  below  us  in  the  ravine  between 
the  two  loyal  regiments.  A  ceasing  of  the  firing 
bespoke  a  compromise.  The  two  bodies  of  troops 
fraternised,  the  Doukkalas  temporarily  abandoned 
their  breeches'  loads  of  grain  on  the  river-bank, 
and  returned  barelegged  to  the  Zimmour  village 
with  their  comrades  the  Abdas.  Once  there  it 
was  the  latter's  turn  to  step  out  of  their  nether 
garments,  and  the  Doukkalas  assisted  them  to 
load  up  the  remaining  grain.  This  done,  the  two 
regiments,  except  for  a  few  killed  and  wounded, 
returned  together,  every  man  bearing  on  his  back 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  71 

his  voluminous  baggy  blue  breeches  stuffed  to 
bursting-point  with  wheat  and  barley.  I  shall 
never  forget  the  sight  of  these  troops  struggling 
up  the  steep  slope,  puffing  and  perspiring,  dressed 
in  the  scarlet  "  zouave  "  coats,  with  just  a  fringe 
of  shirt  encircling  their  waists — and  nothing  else, — 
and  on  the  summit  the  enraged  Sultan  and  his 
Court  and  the  rest  of  the  army,  impotent  to  change 
the  course  of  events.  The  afternoon  was  well 
over,  and  all  thought  of  crossing  the  ravine 
that  night  was  out  of  the  question,  so  the  camp 
was  pitched  on  the  side  we  were  on. 

I  have  passed  many  strange  disturbed  nights  in 
Morocco,  but  this  one  was  perhaps  unique,  for 
the  Doukkalas  and  Abda  regiments  quarrelled 
over  the  division  of  the  spoil,  and  fought  on  and 
off  all  the  night  through.  Bullets  were  flying  in 
every  direction,  and  one  had  to  lie  as  low  to 
ground  as  possible.  Eventually  things  quieted 
down,  and  one  of  my  servants  came  and  announced 
to  me  that  "it  is  all  right.  The  army  is  now 
being  flogged," — which  was  a  fact,  for  the  energetic 
Minister  of  War  had  managed  to  arrest  the  sur- 
vivors of  the  two  regiments  concerned,  and  was 
having  them  individually  severely  flogged  one  after 
the  other  by  soldiers  of  other  regiments  and  slaves 
and  volunteers. 

We  never  crossed  that  ravine.  The  next  day 
the  news  reached  the  Sultan  that  the  army  under 
his  brother  had  been  defeated  by  Bou  Hamara 
near  Taza.  In  all  haste  we  turned  back,  and 
proceeded  once  more  to  Fez.  That  return  journey 


72  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

over  the  track  of  our  advance  brought  to  light 
many  things  of  which  nothing  apparently  had  been 
known,  or  at  least  cared  about,  in  camp.  The 
road  was  strewn  with  dead — stragglers  from  the 
Sultan's  army  who  had  been  cut  off  by  the  rebel 
Zimmours;  for  woe  betide  any  one  who  lagged 
behind.  We  found  in  the  precincts  of  a  country 
mosque  a  dozen  corpses,  decapitated  and  muti- 
lated ;  and  even  the  blind  beggars  on  foot,  whose 
afflictions  made  it  almost  impossible  to  keep  up 
with  the  army,  fell  a  prey  to  the  tribesmen,  and 
not  a  few  were  found  stripped  of  their  poor  belong- 
-\ings  and  with  their  throats  cut.  Woe  betide  the 
wounded,  too — left  to  die  where  they  fell — for  the 
Sultan's  army  possessed  no  hospital  installation  of 
any  kind,  and  no  ambulances.  Every  effort  of 
the  few  doctors  who  from  time  to  time  were 
employed  at  the  Moorish  Court  was  almost  in 
vain.  Only  if  a  fallen  soldier's  comrade  chose  to 
carry  him  to  the  camp  did  he  escape  death  on  the 
field  of  battle ;  but  the  question  of  his  transport 
and  of  his  subsequent  care  rested  entirely  with  his 
comrades,  and  the  Moorish  soldier's  comrades  were 
not  always  prepared  to  make  sacrifices  for  a 
wounded  "  pal."  Often  they  waited  his  death  in 
order  to  steal  his  clothes ;  often  they  stole  his  clothes 
and  left  him  to  perish  without  awaiting  his  death. 
In  camp,  if  there  was  a  doctor,  medical  attend- 
ance was  given,  but  it  was  given  almost  without 
any  encouragement  or  any  help  from  the  Maghzen, 
but  none  the  less  given  whole-heartedly.  Even 
when  the  whole  army  was  attacked  with  malaria, 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  73 

it  was  often  the  doctor  who  supplied  the  entire 
quantity  of  quinine  required  out  of  his  own  pocket. 
The  idea  of  the  value  of  their  men's  lives  never 
seems  to  have  entered  into  the  heads  of  the 
authorities. 

Often  the  soldiers,  if  they  took  the  trouble, 
buried  the  wounded  alive,  to  prevent  their  heads 
being  carried  off  as  trophies  by  the  enemy.  I 
remember  being  told,  while  spending  an  evening 
with  some  of  the  riff-raff  of  the  army — who,  in 
spite  of  their  characters,  were  often  the  most 
jovial  and  cheery  of  companions — the  story  of  a 
recalcitrant  wounded  comrade  who  didn't  want 
to  be  buried  alive.  The  incident  had  happened 
the  same  day.  The  man  was  badly  wounded,  the 
camp  was  a  long  way  off,  and  his  "  pals  "  didn't 
mean  to  have  the  trouble  of  carrying  him  there. 
So  they  dug  his  grave,  and  began  to  push  him  in. 
He  naturally  protested.  "  I  am  not  dead,"  he 
cried ;  "  don't  you  see  I  am  living  ?  "  "Be 
quiet,"  said  a  companion ;  "  you  were  killed  at 
least  an  hour  ago.  Don't  you  realise  that  you  are 
dead  ?  "  The  poor  man  still  cried  out  till  the 
earth  covered  him  and  put  an  end  to  his  protesta- 
tion and  his  life.  The  soldier  who  narrated  the 
incident  added,  "  The  Moorish  soldier  is  an  un- 
grateful and  unbelieving  individual.  This  man,  for 
instance,  had  no  confidence  in  us,  his  comrades, 
when  we  assured  him  he  was  dead.  I  hate  in- 
gratitude,"— and  he  filled  up  his  little  "kif  "  pipe 
and  handed  it  to  us  for  a  whiff. 

Life  was  of  no  value,  but  the  Moorish  soldier  is. 


74  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

I  have  seen  him  often  under  all  circumstances ; 
and  in  spite  of  all  his  faults,  I  have  an  admiration 
and  a  liking  for  him.  He  considered  his  "pal's" 
life  as  nothing,  and  his  own  almost  as  valueless  ; 
and  yet  on  my  many  journeys  I  have  often 
experienced  kindness,  and  never  rudeness,  from 
these  outcasts  of  the  old  regime.  Murderers  often, 
generally  thieves,  and  always  blackguards,  yet 
there  existed  amongst  them  the  undercurrent  of 
the  pride  of  race,  and  a  sense  of  honour  in  their 
dealings  with  a  sympathetic  European,  which  they 
would  have  considered  quite  unnecessary  with  a 
compatriot.  In  all  life  and  on  all  my  journeys 
in  Morocco  I  have  made  a  point  of  trusting  every 
one,  and  seldom,  if  ever,  have  I  been  disappointed. 
I  have  put  natives  taken  from  the  wild  mountain 
districts  into  positions  of  confidence ;  I  have  given 
them  every  facility  to  rob,  but  I  have  trusted  to 
their  honour,  and  they  have  not  failed  me.  I  am 
often  told  I  have  been  and  am  foolish,  and  that 
some  day  ! — but  that  some  day  has  not  come  yet, 
and  my  life  has  been  rendered  far  easier  and  far 
happier  by  the  mutual  confidence  that  has  always 
existed,  and  still,  I  am  glad  to  say,  exists,  between 
the  people  of  this  country  and  myself.  I  start 
out  on  my  journeys  with  this  certain  knowledge, 
that  wherever  I  choose  to  go  I  am  known  at 
least  by  name  and  sure  of  a  welcome. 

A  few  days  after  taking  the  hurried  decision  to 
return,  the  Sultan  reached  Fez,  where  he  remained 
for  several  years,  unable  to  leave  these  disturbed 
regions  where  revolution  was  rife.  In  the  summer 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  75 

of  1903,  having  returned  to  Tangier  meanwhile, 
I  was  captured  by  Raisuli's  tribesmen,  and  spent 
three  weeks  in  captivity  at  Zinat  and  in  the 
Anjera  mountains.  My  experiences  are  narrated 
in  the  chapter  which  deals  with  the  famous  brigand 
and  his  doings. 

In  1904  an  arrangement  was  come  to  between 
France  and  England  regarding  Morocco.  This 
book  does  not  in  any  way  pretend  to  be  a  history, 
and  important  as  this  event  was,  it  need  only 
be  referred  to  here  in  a  few  words.  France  was 
permitted  by  this  agreement  to  intervene  in 
Morocco,  on  the  condition  of  not  changing  the 
political  status  of  the  country,  and  was  given  a 
free  hand  to  preserve  order  and  to  grant  such 
assistance  for  the  introduction  of  certain  reforms 
as  might  be  required.  France  at  the  same  time 
agreed  to  come  to  terms  with  Spain.  All  British 
commercial  rights  and  privileges  were  to  remain 
intact. 

Raisuli  was  all  this  time  in  communication,  if 
not  in  league,  with  Bou  Hamara,  who  remained 
in  the  Taza  and  Oujda  districts.  While  I  was  a 
prisoner  of  Raisuli's  in  1903, 1  managed  to  abstract 
from  a  secret  cupboard  in  the  room  in  which  I  was 
confined  a  number  of  documents  of  considerable 
interest.  One  of  these  was  the  "  dahir  "  of  the 
Pretender  appointing  Raisuli  Governor  of  the 
mountain  tribes  of  North-West  Morocco.  This 
dahir  is  stamped  with  the  great  seal  of  the  Pre- 
tender under  the  name  of  Mohamed  ben  Hassen. 
No  doubt  Raisuli,  who  was  at  this  moment  Mulai 


76  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

Abdul  Aziz's  Governor  in  the  same  districts,  was 
keeping  this  alternative  appointment  up  his  sleeve 
in  a  case  of  the  necessity  arising  of  having  to 
proclaim  the  Pretender  as  Sultan. 

It  was  only  natural  that  this  Anglo-French  agree- 
ment should  bring  about  a  general  spirit  of  unrest 
in  the  country,  and  in  May  1904  Raisuli  captured 
Mr  Perdicaris  and  his  stepson,  Mr  Varley.  They 
were  released  seven  weeks  later  against  a  ransom 
of  £14,000  and  political  advantages  for  Raisuli, 
who  obtained  from  the  Sultan,  Mulai  Abdul  Aziz, 
his  own  appointment  of  Governor  of  the  north- 
west tribes  as  one  of  his  terms. 

Meanwhile  the  situation  in  the  interior  became 
so  serious  that  all  Europeans  were  withdrawn  to 
the  coast,  and  even  at  Tangier  security  was  threat- 
ened. In  December  my  country  villa  was  attacked 
during  the  night,  and  I  narrowly  escaped  a  second 
capture.  The  soldiers  guarding  my  house  were 
seized  and  disarmed  in  the  verandah ;  but  the 
brigands,  under  a  young  chief  called  Ould  Bak- 
kasha,  failed  to  force  an  entrance  into  the  house. 
The  telephone  wire  was  cut,  but  I  had  just  time 
to  get  a  message  through,  and  a  few  hours  later 
troops  arrived.  Our  total  losses  were  one  soldier 
killed  and  one  wounded.  I  had  to  abandon  my 
villa  and  come  and  live  nearer  the  town. 

Ould  Bakkasha,  the  chief  of  this  new  band,  was 
killed  a  few  weeks  later.  He  was  a  young  man, 
of  attractive  manner  and  appearance,  who  evi- 
dently wanted  to  become  a  second  Raisuli ;  but 
fate  was  against  him.  During  a  raid  which  he 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  77 

and  his  men  made  upon  a  village,  he  was  shot. 
He  was  forcing  his  way  into  a  house,  the  owner 
of  which  was  holding  the  door  on  the  inside. 
Unable  to  leave  the  door,  the  owner  of  the  house 
called  to  his  son,  a  mere  boy,  to  bring  him  his 
rifle,  which  was  hanging  on  the  wall.  The  boy 
in  hurrying  to  his  father  fell,  and  the  rifle  went 
off.  The  bullet  pierced  the  closed  door,  and  killed 
Ould  Bakkasha,  who  was  attempting  to  force  an 
entrance  from  without.  The  band  fled,  leaving 
their  chief's  dead  body  on  the  threshold. 

The  year  1905  saw  the  famous  visit  of  the 
Kaiser  to  Tangier,  the  result  of  the  Franco-British 
agreement  of  the  previous  year,  and  of  the  sub- 
sequent action  of  France  in  sending  a  special 
Mission  to  Fez  to  insist  upon  the  introduction  of 
reforms.  It  was  on  31st  March  that  the  Kaiser 
landed.  At  the  last  moment  he  had  hesitated  to 
come  ashore,  partly  on  account  of  the  roughness 
of  the  sea,  and  partly  perhaps  because  he  may 
have  appreciated  the  far-reaching  effects  of  this 
hostile  demonstration  to  France  and  indirectly  to 
England,  and  partly  because  he  feared  assassina- 
tion at  the  hands  of  anarchists. 

The  Emperor  looked  nervous  as  he  rode  through 
the  decorated  streets  to  the  German  Legation. 
Immense  crowds  of  natives,  who  had  been  told 
that  this  visit  meant  the  saving  of  the  indepen- 
dence of  their  country,  had  gathered  on  the  open 
market-place  in  front  of  the  Legation,  and  volley 
after  volley  was  fired  by  them  as  the  Emperor 
arrived  and  left.  Many  of  the  guns  and  rifles 


78  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

contained  bullets,  one  of  which,  in  its  downward 
course,  struck  and  indented  the  leather  helmet  of 
one  of  the  suite,  but  fortunately  no  accident 
occurred.  I  was  in  the  room  while  the  diplomatic 
corps  and  the  native  officials  were  presented  to 
the  Kaiser,  and  heard  both  his  words  to  the 
French  Charge  d' Affaires,  Comte  de  Cherisy,  and 
to  the  Moorish  authorities.  To  both  he  announced 
x^y  his  intention  of  considering  Morocco  as  an  in- 
^j\dependent  country,  and  of  treating  its  Sultan  as 
an  independent  sovereign. 

Fez  became  a  few  months  later  the  scene  of 
action,  for  three  special  Missions — a  British  under 
Mr  (afterwards  Sir  Gerard)  Lowther,  a  French 
Mission  under  Monsieur  Saint  Rene  Taillandier, 
and  a  German  under  Count  Tattenbach — visited 
the  capital.  The  French  Government  was  insisting 
on  the  acceptance  of  its  reform  proposals  by  the 
Sultan,  and  every  assistance  was  being  rendered 
by  the  British  Government  to  obtain  this  desirable 
result ;  but  German  influence  was  too  strong,  and 
the  Sultan  Mulai  Abdul  Aziz  definitely  refused  the 
French  proposals  on  28th  May,  only  a  day  or  two 
before  the  arrival  of  the  British  Mission  in  Fez. 
The  moment  was  cleverly  chosen.  Mr  Lowther's 
Mission  was  en  route  to  the  Court,  and  only  learned 
of  the  Sultan's  decision  on  his  arrival  at  Fez.  He 
was  too  late  to  influence  the  Sultan,  and  too  late 
to  abandon  his  Mission.  This  check  to  France  led 
indirectly  to  the  fall  of  Delcasse  and  the  agree- 
ment to  hold  an  International  Conference  on  the 
subject  of  Morocco. 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  79 

Meanwhile  there  was  no  improvement  in  the 
interior  situation  of  Morocco.  Bou  Hamara  main- 
tained his  rebellion  in  Eastern  Morocco,  and  Raisuli 
governed  in  north-eastern  tribes.  Everywhere 
there  was  insecurity,  and  two  British  officers, 
Captain  Crowther  and  Lieutenant  Hatton,  were 
captured  in  October  on  the  shore  of  the  An j  era 
coast,  where  they  were  employed  in  the  salving 
of  H.M.S.  Assistance,  which  had  gone  ashore  there. 
The  brigand  who  made  this  coup  was  the  Shereef 
Ould  Boulaish,  an  important  Anjera  tribesman. 
Their  release  was  fortunately  obtained  without 
much  difficulty. 

The  Court  had  lost  its  prestige.  The  Sultan  was 
openly  scoffed  at  and  despised,  and  anarchy 
reigned  on  every  side. 

This  final  stage  of  the  history  of  independent 
Morocco  had  begun  and  ended  in  the  early  years 
of  this  century,  when  the  young  Sultan,  Mulai 
Abdul  Aziz,  entered  upon  that  period  of  his  reign 
which  may  be  deservedly  known  as  the  years  of 
the  commis  voyageurs.  It  was  a  pitiful  period  and 
one  best  forgotten,  except  that  every  now  and 
again  some  incident  would  occur  worth  recording 
on  account  of  its  perfectly  unintentional  humour, 
which  only  rendered  more  pitiful  still  the  depress- 
ing interludes.  It  was  the  last  decadence  of  the] 
decadent  Moorish  Court.  The  Treasury  was  fast 
being  emptied,  the  revenues  were  being  wasted, 
foreign  loans  were  being  raised,  and  the  palaces 
of  the  Sultan  were  littered  with  packing-cases, 
the  contents  of  which  the  British  Press  once  seri- 


80  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

ously  described  as  "  evidences  of  Christian  civilisa- 
tion at  Fez."  Everywhere  it  was  packing-cases, 
and  even  to-day  on  some  of  the  tracks  from  the 
coast  to  the  interior  lie  the  wrecked  fragments  of 
machinery  and  other  rusty  forsaken  goods,  which 
the  weary  camels  could  transport  no  longer. 

Of  what  did  these  "  evidences  of  Christian  civil- 
isation "  consist  ?  Grand  pianos  and  kitchen- 
ranges  ;  automobiles  and  immense  cases  of  corsets  ; 
wild  animals  in  cages,  and  boxes  of  strange  theatri- 
cal uniforms  ;  barrel-organs  and  hansom-cabs  ;  a 
passenger  lift  capable  of  rising  to  dizzy  altitudes, 
destined  for  a  one  -  storied  palace  ;  false  hair ; 
cameras  of  gold  and  of  silver  with  jewelled  buttons  ; 
carved  marble  lions  and  living  macaw  parrots ; 
jewels,  real  and  false ;  steam-launches  and  fire- 
works ;  ladies'  underclothing  from  Paris,  and 
saddlery  from  Mexico ;  trees  for  gardens  that 
were  never  planted,  or,  if  planted,  were  never 
watered  ;  printing-presses  and  fire-balloons — an 
infinity  of  all  that  was  grotesque,  useless,  and  in 
bad  taste.  As  each  packing-case  gave  forth  its 
contents  they  were  looked  at,  perhaps  played  with, 
and  the  majority  speedily  consigned  to  rust  and 
rot  in  damp  stores  and  damper  cellars.  It  was, 
indeed,  a  glorious  period  for  the  commis  voyageurs, 
but  it  was  the  "  agony "  of  Morocco.  Every 
incident  in  Europe  was  seized  to  push  their  wares. 
The  coronation  of  King  Edward  VII.  brought 
crowns  to  the  fore.  The  Sultan  was  told  he  must 
have  a  crown.  He  objected.  It  was  contrary  to 
his  religion  to  put  gold  or  jewels  on  his  head. 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  81 

But  escape  was  impossible.  A  coloured  oleograph 
was  spread  out  before  him  representing  King 
Edward  in  his  coronation  robes,  standing  by  a 
small  table,  with  his  index  finger  lightly  resting 
on  the  summit  of  the  Imperial  Crown.  This  at 
least  was  a  purpose  to  which  the  Sultan,  without 
infringing  the  tenets  of  Islam,  could  put  a  crown. 
So  the  crown  came. 

The  crown,  it  was  rumoured,  came  from  Paris ; 
but  the  State  coach  was  British,  and  London's 
best,  built  by  a  famous  coach-builder,  and  of  fine 
workmanship.  The  afternoon  that  it  arrived, 
transported  in  packing-cases  carried  on  platforms, 
which  in  turn  were  slung  between  camels,  the 
Sultan  was  playing  bicycle-polo  with  some  of  his 
European  suite,  which  included  at  this  period  an 
architect,  a  conjurer,  a  watchmaker,  an  American 
portrait-painter,  two  photographers,  a  German 
lion-tamer,  a  French  soda-water  manufacturer,  a 
chauffeur,  a  firework  expert,  and  a  Scottish  piper. 
All  these  enjoyed  the  personal  friendship  of  His 
Majesty,  and  the  entree  into  the  presence  of  the 
ruler  who,  with  the  exception  perhaps  of  the 
Grand  Lama  of  Thibet,  should  have  been  the  most 
exclusive  and  the  most  secluded  of  sovereigns. 
It  is  no  wonder  that  the  tribesmen  looked  askance 
on  the  high  palace  walls. 

It  was  a  gorgeous  coach,  of  crimson  lacquer, 
with  gilded  ornamentation.  The  inside  was  lined 
with  rich  green-brocaded  silk,  and  the  hammer- 
cloth  was  of  scarlet  and  gold,  and  bore  what  were 
supposed  to  be  the  Royal  Arms  of  Morocco— as  a 

F 


82  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

fact,  non-existent.  Like  the  coach  itself,  the 
purple  harness,  with  its  gilt  fittings,  was  of  the 
very  best ;  and  together  they  formed  an  ensemble 
as  expensive  as  it  was  utterly  useless,  for  there 
were  no  roads  in  Morocco. 

The  bicycle-polo  ceased,  and  the  Sultan  invited 
the  Consul  of  a  great  foreign  Power,  who  hap- 
pened to  be  at  the  Court,  and  the  writer,  to  come 
and  inspect  his  newest  purchase.  In  the  centre 
of  an  immense  field  of  swampy  grass,  surrounded 
by  high  crenellated  walls,  stood  the  scarlet  car- 
riage. In  this  field  of  many  acres  were  opened 
all  the  packing-cases  which  were  too  large  to  pass 
through  the  gateways  that  led  into  the  interior 
courts  of  the  palace ;  it  served  also  as  a  grazing- 
ground  for  His  Majesty's  menagerie.  In  a  wide 
circle  at  some  little  distance  from  the  State  coach 
stood  a  ring  of  zebras,  emus,  wapiti,  Hindu  cattle, 
apes,  antelope,  and  llamas,  with  a  background 
of  more  timid  flamingos  and  strange  storks  and 
cranes — one  and  all  intent  on  examining,  from  a 
position  of  safety,  the  extraordinary  scarlet  addi- 
tion to  their  numbers  which  had  suddenly  appeared 
among  them. 

The  Sultan  was  evidently  pleased.  As  usual, 
he  said  little  ;  but  he  called  to  one  of  his  officers, 
and  ordered  four  horses  to  be  harnessed  to  the 
coach.  It  had  to  be  explained  to  him  that  no 
horse  in  the  Imperial  stables  had  ever  been  in 
harness,  for  the  Sultan's  previous  purchases  of 
carriages  and  hansom-cabs  lay  rotting  idle  and 
neglected  in  stores  and  cellars.  But  His  Majesty 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  83 

was  not  going  to  be  deprived  of  the  pleasure  of 
seeing  his  coach  in  movement.  Men — soldiers  and 
slaves — were  harnessed  and  told  to  pull.  Slowly 
the  lumbering,  useless,  expensive  but  glorious  State 
coach  began  to  move. 

"  We  will  ride  in  it,"  said  the  Sultan ;  and, 
beckoning  to  the  Consul  of  a  Great  Power  to  get 
up  behind,  he  himself  mounted  to  the  scarlet-and- 
gold  seat  of  honour  on  the  box.  The  writer  rode 
inside.  When  all  were  seated,  the  vehicle  started 
on  its  first  and  last  progress  of  State.  The  soldiers 
and  slaves  sweated  and  puffed  as  the  wheels  sank 
deeper  and  deeper  into  the  swampy  ground,  and 
the  "  progress  "  was  slow  indeed.  Slow,  too,  were 
the  paces  of  the  procession  that  followed  us,  for, 
doubting  but  fascinated,  the  whole  menagerie  was 
in  our  wake,  led  by  an  emu  whose  courage  had 
already  been  proved  by  an  unprovoked  attack 
upon  the  Scottish  piper,  and  by  having  danced  a 
pas-seul  on  the  prostrate  form  of  the  expert  in 
fireworks  a  few  days  previously.  Close  behind 
the  emu  followed  a  wapiti — with  the  mange — and 
then  in  turn  the  zebras,  the  Hindu  cattle,  the 
apes,  gazelles,  and  lastly,  the  timid  llamas,  with 
their  great  luminous  eyes  and  outstretched  necks. 
Away  in  the  background  half  a  dozen  cranes 
were  dancing  and  performing  the  most  absurd 
antics. 

It  rained  that  night,  and  the  next  day  the  little 
lake  of  water  in  which  the  State  coach  stood  was 
purple  from  the  dye  of  the  harness,  and  the  beau- 
tiful hammer-cloth  of  scarlet  and  gold  flapped

limp  and  ruined  in  the  wind.    Inside  there  was  a 
pool  of  water  on  the  green-brocaded  seat. 

The  great  fault,  or  misfortune,  of  Mulai  Abdul 
Aziz  was  his  extravagance.  He  was  never  able 
to  realise  the  value  of  money.  He  spent,  in  the 
few  years  since  he  emerged  from  the  seclusion  of 
his  palace  to  take  up  the  reins  of  government,  not 
only  the  whole  revenue  of  his  country,  but  also 
the  savings  of  his  predecessors.  And  what  had 
he  got  for  it  all  ?  A  lot  of  rubbish,  bought  at 
fabulous  prices,  which  was  lying  rotting  and  rust- 
ing in  the  gloomy  cavernous  stores  of  his  various 
palaces  !  He  was  to  blame  for  this  extravagance, 
no  doubt,  but  others  were  to  blame  still  more. 
Those  to  whom  he  looked  for  advice  left  no  stone 
unturned  to  exploit  him.  They  made  their  for- 
tunes, and  left  a  broken  unhappy  Sultan,  whose 
whole  country  was  in  rebellion,  whose  Treasury 
was  exhausted,  to  bear  the  brunt  of  their  sins. 
Mulai  Abdul  Aziz,  full  of  the  vigour  of  youth, 
anxious  to  learn,  anxious  to  reform  his  country, 
anxious  to  do  what  was  right,  had  a  future  be- 
fore him  of  much  useful  work.  His  advisers  took 
his  education  in  hand — and  his  education  cost 
him  dear,  for  his  fortune,  his  influence  with  his 
subjects,  and  his  reputation  had  all  gone.  He 
was  weak  and  young  and  sometimes  stubborn  ; 
but  no  man  ever  lived  whose  intentions  were 
better ;  but  these  intentions  were  warped  and 
frustrated  by  his  advisers.  The  Sultan  had  no 
disinterested  person  about  him ;  no  disinterested 
advice  was  given  him.  He  was  told,  when  he 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  85 

spent  his  money  in  ordering  useless  goods  from  . 
the  various  European  countries,  that  it  gave  satis-  I 
faction  to  the  Governments  of  those  respective  I 
countries  that  he  made  his  purchases  in  their/ 
markets. 

Few  of  the  things  that  he  bought  gave  him  any 
pleasure.  Photography  amused  him  for  a  time  ; 
but  even  this  was  made  a  means  of  exploiting 
him.  A  camera  of  gold  at  £2000  came  from 
London ;  10,000  francs'  worth  of  photographic 
paper  arrived  in  one  day  from  Paris.  His  Majesty 
once  informed  me  that  his  photographic  materials, 
not  including  cameras  and  lenses,  for  one  year 
cost  him  between  £6000  and  £7000  !  He  natu- 
rally did  not  know  what  was  required,  and  left  it 
to  his  commission  agents  to  purchase  the  "  neces- 
sary "  materials.  They  did,  with  a  vengeance. 

But  it  must  not  be  thought  that  the  Sultan 
lived  no  other  life  except  this.  His  frivolity  was 
of  short  duration — an  hour  or  two  perhaps  every 
day ;  but  at  other  times  affairs  of  State  took 
up  his  attention,  though  scarcely  as  much  as 
ought  to  have  been  the  case.  He  could,  too,  on 
occasion  be  remarkably  serious  in  his  conversa- 
tions ;  and  as  he  possessed  a  quick  intelligent 
mind,  much  prone  to  speculation,  his  talk  was 
often  exceedingly  interesting,  and  there  were  many 
occasions  when,  alone  with  him  for  an  hour  or 
two  at  a  time,  he  let  his  words  flow  on  from  sub- 
ject to  subject.  On  the  question  of  religion  he 
was  by  no  means  a  fanatic,  though  in  every  way 
a  strict  and  orthodox  Moslem,  in  spite  of  many 


86  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

stories  to  the  contrary.  His  faults  have  been 
against  the  traditions  of  his  predecessors,  and 
never  against  his  religion,  though  the  two  are  so 
indissolubly  mixed  in  the  minds  of  the  people 
that  they  are  incapable  of  distinguishing  one  from 
the  other,  and  so  the  untrue  rumours  which  were 
spread  broadcast  all  over  Morocco  appeared  as 
based  on  fact.  He  would  never  have  attracted 
attention  and  suspicion  had  he  been  a  little  better 
advised.  The  men  who  bought  him  European 
boots  and  European  saddles,  to  their  own  profit 
and  to  his  unmaking,  were  almost  guilty  of  high 
treason.  The  men  who  ordered  fancy  European 
uniforms  for  him  in  the  European  capitals,  as  well 
as  the  men  who  photographed  him  in  them,  and 
allowed  his  photograph  to  appear  in  the  illustrated 
papers  of  Europe,  could  almost  have  been  tried 
for  attempted  regicide.  From  the  newspaper  to 
the  picture  post-card,  the  "  Commander  of  the 
Faithful,"  the  religious  head  of  Islam  in  North- 
West  Africa,  was  exhibited  in  a  variety  of 
costumes  in  the  Tangier  shop  windows  and  sold 
for  a  halfpenny:  and  this  in  a  country  where 
pictures  are  considered  as  contrary  to  religion. 
That  Mulai  Abdul  Aziz  was  weak  there  is  no 
doubt ;  but  how  easy  it  is  to  be  weak  in  such 
circumstances,  for  every  one  was  pushing  him  on, 
helping  him  day  by  day  to  become  more  and 
more  unpopular,  seeing  his  authority  and  his 
country  slipping  away  from  him — "  educating  " 
him,  in  fact,  for  so  they  called  it,  until  in  the 
end  they  left  him  with  an  empty  Treasury  to 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  87 

bear  the  brunt  of  the  coming  crisis.  Every  com-^\ 
mission  agent  had  his  vizier-partner,  who  recom- 
mended that  particular  agent  and  his  goods,  and 
shared  the  profits.  There  was  no  one,  actually  no 
one,  who  could  make  his  voice  heard  in  the  sur- 
roundings of  intrigue  and — "  education." 

Had  the  men  who  really  influenced  him  pressed 
him  to  stop  buying  instead  of  to  buy,  he  would 
have  done  so,  but  such  was  not  their  obj 
They  kept  back  from  him  the  state  of  the  country, 
and  made  little  of  the  rebellion  which  was  smoulder- 
ing all  around  him.  The  one  man  who  realised 
more  than  the  rest  how  badly  things  were  going 
was  the  only  man  of  energy  at  the  Moorish  Court, 
Sid  Mehdi  el-Menebhi,  who  had  been  a  special  < 
ambassador  at  London  and  Berlin.  He  ventured 
once  or  twice  to  speak  seriously,  but  the  mass  of 
intrigue  against  him  was  too  great.  I  remember 
one  incident  so  well.  It  was  in  December  1902. 
I  was  leaving  Fez  in  the  course  of  a  few  days 
for  Tangier,  when  I  received  from  an  unknown 
country  Moor  news  that  the  Pretender's  forces, 
which,  my  informant  said,  were  very  numerous, 
were  on  the  point  of  attacking  the  camp  of 
the  huge  disorderly  army  which  Mulai  Abdul 
Aziz  had  sent  out  of  Fez  a  day's  march 
to  the  eastward.  I  had  reason  to  believe  this 
news  then,  and  I  have  reason  to  believe  to- 
day that  it  was  sent  me  in  order  that  I  might 
leave  Fez,  for  the  Pretender  at  that  time  intended 
to  follow  his  attack  on  the  camp  with  a  march 
on  the  capital.  My  informant,  an  uneducated 


88  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

countryman,  mentioned,  as  a  guarantee  of  good 
faith,  an  incident  which  had  happened  some  years 
before  at  Meknes,  in  which  I  had  apparently  been 
able  to  render  some  small  service  to  a  Moor  whose 
name  at  that  time  I  did  not  know.  It  was  Jilali 
Zarhouni,  the  Pretender  himself,  who  four  years 
afterwards,  mindful  of  my  little  act,  sent  me  this 
word  of  warning. 

I  reported  the  whole  matter  to  the  Sultan,  whom 
I  saw  alone  that  night,  but  I  could  make  no  impres- 
sion upon  His  Majesty.  He  laughed  at  the  rebel- 
lion and  at  my  fears  for  his  troops,  at  the  Pre- 
tender and  his  reputed  forces.  "  Go,"  he  said,  "  to 
Menebhi,  and  tell  him  from  me  to  give  you  a 
good  dinner,  with  musicians  and  '  kooskoosoo,' 
and  don't  worry  yourself.  Your  fears  are  ground- 
less." Menebhi  gave  me  the  good  dinner,  but  he 
knew  my  fears  were  not  groundless.  We  sat  late 
into  the  night  talking — he  was  Minister  of  War  at 
the  time — and  I  think  he  was  persuaded  that 
some  steps  must  be  taken.  Before  we  parted  we 
had  further  evidence  of  how  serious  things  were 
becoming,  for  a  Shereef,  who  had  relations  at 
Taza,  had  received  news  which  confirmed  my 
estimate  of  the  Pretender's  forces,  though  not  of 
his  proposed  attempt  to  attack  the  Government 
troops. 

The  next  day  I  bade  farewell  to  Mulai  Abdul 
Aziz.  He  was  standing  under  a  great  archway  in 
the  palace.  He  tried  to  persuade  me  to  stay,  but 
for  many  reasons  I  had  to  be  back  in  Tangier  in 
eight  or  ten  days'  time.  We  stood  there  a  while 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  89 

talking,  and  nothing  could  have  been  more  kind 
than  he  was. 

"  I  shall  miss  you  much,"  he  said  ;  "  good-bye," 
and  with  a  shake  of  the  hand  he  left  me.  I  turned 
and  watched  his  tall  figure,  draped  in  white,  until 
he  disappeared  into  the  palace  through  a  gate  in 
the  garden  wall.  It  was  Monday,  22nd  December 
1902.  That  very  evening,  some  forty  miles  away, 
his  whole  army  fled  in  a  panic  before  the  Pre- 
tender's forces,  leaving  their  entire  camp,  artillery, 
stores,  ammunition,  money,  and  transport  in  the 
hands  of  Bou  Hamara. 

The  commander  of  the  Sultan's  forces  that 
suffered  this  severe  defeat  was  Mulai  Abdesalam 
el-Amarani,  His  Majesty's  uncle.  He  was  an 
elderly  and  much-respected  member  of  the  royal 
family,  who,  with  a  brother,  Sid  Mohamed  el- 
Amarani,  had  played  a  considerable  and  worthy 
part  in  Moorish  politics.  That  he  possessed  any 
military  capacity  is  doubtful ;  but  his  name  and 
his  already  proved  political  influence  rendered  him 
a  suitable  person  to  command  such  expeditions, 
on  which  diplomacy  was  always,  if  possible,  pre- 
ferred to  fighting. 

On  my  next  visit  to  Fez,  Mulai  Abdesalam 
el-Amarani  described  to  me  the  attack  of  Bou 
Hamara's  forces  upon  the  camp  of  the  Sultan's 
army.  His  description  of  his  own  terror  was 
pathetic.  "  I  had  no  time,"  he  said,  "  to  collect 
my  valuables,  but  there  were  two  things  I  did 
not  want  to  leave  behind — a  sack  of  money  and 
the  pills  Dr  Verdon  had  given  me  for  my  indiges- 


90  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

tion.  The  money  was  beside  my  bed,  the  pills 
under  the  mattress,  and  I  couldn't  find  them  at 
once,  and  between  this  loss  and  my  terror  and  the 
sound  of  firing  in  the  camp  I  had  to  flee.  It  was 
not  until  I  was  on  my  mule  that  I  discovered  that 
in  my  excitement  I  had  forgotten  both  the  money 
and  the  pills." 


IV. 


THE   BEGINNING   OF   THE   END. 

IN  spite  of  his  extravagances,  the  life  which  the 
Sultan  led  was  a  very  simple  one.  He  rose  early, 
and  after  prayers  at  dawn  left  the  privacy  of  his 
palace  for  the  buildings  in  which  he  held  his 
Court.  Here  he  took  his  seat,  generally  upon  a 
settee  or  divan,  in  a  private  room,  a  little  way 
removed  from  the  great  courtyard  in  which  his 
viziers  carried  on  then:  business.  This  courtyard 
was  surrounded  by  a  colonnade  on  to  which  opened 
a  number  of  small  rooms.  In  these  were  seated 
the  various  viziers  and  their  secretaries,  while 
without  in  the  shade  of  the  colonnade  sat  those 
who  sought  interviews  with  the  various  Secre- 
taries of  State.  A  gateway,  guarded  always  by 
gatekeepers,  led  from  this  courtyard  to  the  Sultan's 
private  offices,  and  messages  and  letters  passed 
to  and  fro.  From  time  to  time  he  would  summon 
one  or  other  of  the  viziers  to  his  presence  on  affairs 
of  State,  and  discuss  with  them  what  course  it 
might  be  best  to  pursue.  It  can  be  understood 
from  this  slight  intercourse  that  His  Majesty  held 
with  the  outside  world,  for  he  seldom  had  more 


92  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

than  this,  how  easy  it  was  for  the  people  of  his 
entourage  to  withhold  from  him  all  reliable  in- 
formation, and  to  paint  the  existing  state  of  affairs 
in  the  colours  that  might  suit  their  own  views,  or, 
more  often,  their  own  pockets. 

"  Court,"  which  commenced  in  the  early  morning, 
was  finished  by  noon,  and  the  Sultan  retired  into 
the  palace,  where  he  dined.  He  ate  always  alone, 
and,  as  is  the  custom  all  over  Morocco,  with  his 
fingers.  This  habit,  which  seems  almost  revolting 
to  Europeans,  is  by  no  means  an  unclean  one, 
for  the  hands  are  washed  in  warm  water  both 
before  and  after  the  meal,  and  the  food  is 
always  cooked  in  such  a  way  that  it  can  easily 
be  broken.  A  habit  of  our  own,  which  we  con- 
sider far  more  cleanly  than  eating  with  our  fingers, 
is  looked  upon  by  the  Moors  as  filthy — that  is, 
washing  our  hands  or  face  in  a  basin,  and,  still 
more,  taking  a  bath  where  the  water  is  not  running. 
The  cleaner  we  become,  they  say,  the  dirtier  the 
water  we  are  washing  with  must  necessarily  be, 
and  eventually  we  step  forth  as  cleansed  from 
water  which  is  no  longer  clean.  A  Moor  to  wash 
his  hands  has  the  water  poured  from  a  vessel  over 
them,  and  never  by  any  chance  dips  them  into 
the  dirty  water.  The  same  way  in  their  baths  : 
the  water  is  thrown  over  their  bodies  out  of  bright 
brass  bowls,  and  flows  away  through  holes  in  the 
marble  or  tile  floor. 

His  midday  meal  over,  the  Sultan  would  rest 
for  a  while,  generally  issuing  from  the  palace 
about  three  o'clock.  There  was  no  afternoon 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  93 

"  Court,"  and  on  this  account  Mulai  Abdul  Aziz 
was  free  to  spend  the  rest  of  the  day  as  he  pleased, 
and  generally  did  so  in  the  company  of  his  Euro- 
pean employees  and  friends.  Bicycle-polo,  cricket, 
and  tennis  were  the  order  of  the  day. 

One  evening,  after  a  longer  game  of  tennis  than 
usual,  we  commenced  to  take  in  the  net,  as  rain 
seemed  probable.  His  Majesty  had  just  retired 
into  the  palace,  but  had  left  his  pocket-handker- 
chief tied  to  the  top  of  the  net,  where  he  had 
fixed  it,  as  the  light  was  waning,  and  it  was  diffi- 
cult to  distinguish  the  net's  height.  I  unfastened 
the  handkerchief,  but  feeling  something  large  tied 
up  in  a  corner  of  it,  I  examined  it  more  carefully. 
It  was  a  cut  diamond,  about  the  size  of  a  small 
walnut,  which  His  Majesty  had  lately  purchased. 
Carefully  secreting  the  handkerchief  and  its  valu- 
able contents  in  my  pocket — for  there  is  no  means 
of  getting  at  the  Sultan  once  he  has,  entered  the 
recesses  of  the  palace,  where  women  only  are 
allowed — I  proceeded  to  leave  the  precincts  by  the 
usual  exit.  I  had  crossed  one  courtyard  and  was 
near  the  outer  gate  when  I  became  aware  that 
some  one  was  pursuing  me.  I  took  in  the  situa- 
tion and  ran  ;  but  I  was  no  match  for  the  Sultan, 
who,  stirred  to  more  than  usual  activity  by  the 
loss  of  his  valuable  jewel,  came  down  upon  me 
like  a  whirlwind.  Almost  before  I  realised  that  I 
was  caught,  I  was  lifted  off  my  feet  and  thrown 
to  the  ground,  while  Mulai  Abdul  Aziz,  his  knees 
pinning  down  my  elbows,  was  rifling  my  pockets. 
He  soon  discovered  his  diamond,  still  tied  in  the 


94  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

handkerchief;  but,  not  content  with  that,  he  de- 
prived me  of  a  pocket-book,  a  ring  I  was  wearing 
on  my  watch-chain,  a  necktie-pin,  and  a  cigarette- 
case.  He  let  me  go  at  last,  laughing  at  the  adven- 
ture, but  I  never  saw  my  property  again. 

On  another  occasion  I  was  present  when  one 
of  the  Court  officials  came  to  offer  his  respects  to 
the  Sultan  on  receiving  a  high  appointment.  This 
man  was  the  now  famous  Haj  Omar  Tazzi,  the 
present  vizier  of  Government  domains. 

I  was  standing  talking  to  His  Majesty  alone  in 
a  courtyard  along  one  side  of  which  were  situated 
the  cages  of  the  Sultan's  wild  beasts,  when  Haj 
Omar  entered.  Prostrating  himself  barefoot  on  the 
marble  floor,  he  touched  the  ground  with  his 
forehead.  The  Sultan,  scarcely  heeding  him,  made 
a  few  formal  remarks,  and  then  turning  to  me, 
asked  abruptly,  "  Do  you  know  this  man  ?  " 

I  scarcely  did,  but  aware  of  His  Majesty's  love 
of  humour,  I  thought  I  saw  the  opportunity  for 
a  practical  joke  upon  Haj  Omar,  whom,  being  a 
Fez  town  Moor,  I  rightly  guessed  to  be  a 
coward. 

"  I  know  him  well,"  I  replied.  "  Only  to-day 
he  was  at  my  house  begging  me  to  ask  a  favour 
of  your  Majesty  on  his  account." 

Haj  Omar,  who  was  still  prostrate  on  the  ground, 
looked  uneasily  in  my  direction,  not  understanding 
what  was  passing. 

"  His  favour  is  granted,"  replied  the  Sultan, 
to  whom  I  had  made  a  slight  signal  to  allow  me 
to  continue. 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  95 

"  He  asked,"  I  went  on,  "  that  this  afternoon, 
when  summoned  to  your  Majesty's  presence  for 
the  first  time  in  his  new  position,  he  might  be 
allowed  to  give  some  proof  of  his  fidelity." 

"  Certainly,"  replied  Mulai  Abdul  Aziz. 

"  He  proposed,"  I  continued,  "  with  your 
Majesty's  permission,  in  order  that  his  fidelity 
and  courage  might  be  put  to  the  test,  to  spend 
half  an  hour  in  the  lions'  cage." 

Haj  Omar,  still  prostrate  before  the  Sultan, 
squirmed  uneasily,  and  lifted  a  fat  pasty  face 
toward  the  Sultan  and  myself. 

"  Certainly,"  replied  the  Sultan. 

"  If  your  Majesty  bids  me  die,  I  am  ready  to 
do  so,"  came  a  feeble  voice  trembling  with  emotion 
from  the  ground. 

"  Call  the  slave  who  has  the  keys  of  the  lions' 
cage,"  replied  the  Sultan,  and  at  the  same  time 
he  moved  in  the  direction  of  the  wild  beasts, 
Haj  Omar  following  him  on  all-fours. 

The  slave  arrived ;  but  Haj  Omar's  terror  was 
now  so  evident  that  the  joke  could  no  longer  be 
kept  up.  Seizing  me  by  the  hand,  the  Sultan  led 
me  away,  and  Haj  Omar  fled. 

We  played  another  joke  on  Haj  Omar  before 
I  left  Fez,  and  on  this  occasion  Menebhi  was  my 
accomplice,  if  not  my  instigator. 

Haj  Omar  was  pointing  out  to  the  Sultan  the 
arrangement  of  a  new  flower-garden  then  in  course 
of  construction.  His  Majesty  stood  somewhat  in 
advance,  and  the  rather  stout,  pompous  little 
courtier  a  little  behind  him  on  his  right.  Menebhi 


96  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

and  I,  who  had  wandered  a  short  distance  in 
another  direction,  soon  made  a  discovery — a  pump 
and  a  long  hose !  Standing  the  pump  in  the 
water-tank,  I  proceeded  with  the  hose  till  I  reached 
Haj  Omar,  and  just  as  I  put  the  nozzle  down  the 
back  of  his  neck,  Menebhi  began  to  pump.  The 
rich  Moors  never  wash  with  cold  water,  and  the 
voluminous  stream  which  began  to  flow  down  Haj 
Omar's  back  nearly  caused  him  to  have  a  fit. 
The  water  poured  out  of  his  baggy  trousers  into 
his  yellow  slippers,  but  he  daren't  say  a  word, 
for  His  Majesty  was  addressing  him.  "  It  shall 
be  done  as  your  Majesty  commands,"  he  replied, 
when  the  Sultan  had  ceased  speaking ;  but  his 
voice  was  so  trembling,  so  truly  pitiful,  that  Mulai 
Abdul  Aziz  turned  hurriedly  to  see  what  had 
happened.  It  was  a  sad  object  that  met  his  view 
— Haj  Omar  Tazzi  standing  shivering  and  dripping 
in  a  pool  of  water.  Etiquette  forbids  the  Sultan 
to  laugh  in  public,  but  etiquette  couldn't  help  him 
covering  his  face  with  the  long  sleeve  of  his  jelab 
to  hide  his  merriment,  and  walking  hurriedly  in 
another  direction. 

The  mention  of  etiquette  recalls  to  my  mind 
one  or  two  of  the  "  traditions  "  of  the  Moorish 
Court.  In  comparison  with  the  barbaric  splendour 
of  the  Sultan's  State  appearances  in  public,  when, 
in  the  shade  of  the  crimson-and-green  velvet 
umbrella,  he  receives  his  tribesmen,  his  private 
life  is  simple.  There  is  perhaps  no  more  pic- 
turesque sight  in  the  world  than  one  of  these 
Morocco  processions.  The  ragged  troops  in  blue 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  97 

and  red,  who,  with  a  background  of  crumbling 
yellow  walls,  line  the  palace  squares ;  the  blue 
sky  above ;  the  led  horses  in  their  gorgeous  trap- 
pings of  coloured  silks;  the  white-robed  Court 
officials  on  foot ;  the  splendour  of  gold-embroidered 
banners ;  and  in  the  centre  of  it  all  the  Sultan  him- 
self, swathed  in  flowing  white  robes,  the  only 
figure  on  horseback — all  help  to  form  a  picture 
that,  once  seen,  can  never  be  forgotten.  Then 
suddenly  a  great  cry  rends  the  air,  "  May  God 
bless  the  life  of  our  Lord  the  Sultan  !  "  and  the 
motley  company  bow  low  as  His  Majesty,  still 
shaded  by  the  great  umbrella  of  State,  rides  into 
their  midst.  Compared  in  picturesqueness  to  this 
gorgeous  pageant,  European  State  ceremonies  are 
poor  indeed.  But  in  his  private  life  the  Sultan  is 
simple  enough.  No  man,  of  course,  crosses  the 
precincts  of  the  inner  palace,  where  women  only 
are  allowed  to  enter ;  but  Mulai  Abdul  Aziz  on 
several  occasions  spoke  to  me  of  the  boredom  of 
his  domestic  life.  He  recounted  one  or  two  facts 
which  show  that,  autocratic  monarch  as  he  is,  his 
actions  are  much  restricted  by  precedent.  One 
of  these  referred  to  his  bedroom,  which  must  be 
furnished  in  the  greatest  simplicity,  and  one  colour 
alone  must  be  used,  a  deep,  beautiful,  indigo  blue. 
The  silk  hangings  are  made  and  dyed  in  Morocco, 
and  no  European  material  must  be  employed. 
Curtains,  bedcovers,  carpets,  and  wall-hangings 
must  all  be  of  this  one  colour  and  manufacture. 
Again,  when  out  in  camp  his  sleeping-tent  must 
contain  but  three  carpets,  and  he  must  sleep  on 

G 


98  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

a  mattress  on  the  ground,  and  not  on  a  bedstead. 
His  viziers  and  courtiers  cover  the  floor  of  their 
tents  with  straw,  over  which  they  lay  matting 
and  piles  of  rich  carpets ;  but  the  Sultan  may 
have  nothing  but  the  bare  earth  and  the  tradi- 
tional three  small  carpets.  In  wet  weather  he  is 
obliged  to  wade  ankle-deep  in  mud,  while  slaves 
wait  to  wash  his  feet  as  he  steps  on  to  the  rug  on 
which  the  mattress  is  spread.  No  doubt  this 
simple  sleeping-tent  owes  its  origin  to  days  when 
constant  dangers  threatened  the  Sultans  on  their 
camping  expeditions,  and  when  they  were  liable 
to  be  called  up  at  night  to  lead  their  troops  into 
battle ;  but  however  it  may  have  originated,  the 
custom — a  particularly  uncomfortable  one — re- 
mains unchanged  to-day.  During  the  daytime  the 
Sultan  may  spend  his  time  in  other  tents,  where 
no  restrictions  are  placed  upon  his  luxuries  and 
comforts. 

There  is  a  certain  room  in  the  palace  at  Fez 
to  which  a  recognised  tradition  pertains.  The 
construction  dates  from  a  remote  time,  and  there 
is  supposed  to  exist,  somewhere  built  into  its 
walls,  a  certain  charm.  The  purport  of  this  charm 
is  that  as  long  as  this  particular  chamber  in  the 
palace  remains  intact,  no  Sultan  will  die  in  Fez, 
and,  curiously  enough,  no  Sultan  has  died  in  Fez 
since  the  room  was  built.  His  Majesty  described 
the  chamber  to  me,  for  it  is  situated  in  the  interior 
of  the  palace,  where  no  men  may  enter.  It  is  a 
large  hall,  richly  furnished  with  its  original  rugs 
and  divans,  and  every  night  special  slaves,  whose 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  99 

duty  it  is,  light  the  many  candles  that  are  sup- 
ported in  the  chandeliers.  Two  huge  candles, 
brought  from  Mecca  once  a  year,  are  the  only 
ones  that  are  lit  more  than  once ;  all  the  others 
are  replaced  nightly.  Nor  may  European  candles 
be  used — they  must  be  of  Fez  manufacture. 

The  ceiling,  rich  in  carving,  still  exists,  but  the 
roof  above  has  been  replaced  again  and  again, 
one  layer  above  another,  without  ever  removing 
the  underneath  ones,  lest  the  "charm"  should  be 
destroyed.  In  the  same  way  the  walls  have  been 
strengthened  from  the  outside,  until  their  thick- 
ness is  immense.  So  exactly  has  this  room  been 
left  in  its  original  state  that  in  one  corner  of  it 
stands  a  ladder  which  has  never  been  removed, 
while  skins  for  holding  water  are  still  hanging 
upon  the  walls,  little  left  of  them  but  their  gold 
spouts  and  pendent  cups. 

Mulai  Abdul  Aziz  was  an  expert  bicyclist,  and 
there  were  often  great  games  of  bicycle-polo  of  an 
afternoon  in  one  of  the  courtyards  of  the  palace. 
The  only  other  Moor  who  played  was  Menebhi, 
then  at  the  height  of  his  power  and  influence. 
The  Sultan  was  a  plucky  but  careful  rider,  seldom 
coming  to  grief,  and  handling  his  machine  with 
the  most  perfect  judgment.  Menebhi  was  equally 
plucky,  but  much  more  excitable,  and  I  have  seen 
him,  in  pursuit  of  the  ball,  charge  at  full  speed 
into  the  palace  wall,  to  be  rescued  from  what 
looked  like  a  lot  of  broken  umbrellas  a  minute 
later,  as  he  shouted  wildly  for  a  new  bicycle.  As 
the  Sultan  was  always  supplied  with  the  most 


100  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

expensive  articles  that  could  be  purchased,  most 
of  his  bicycles  were  of  aluminium,  and  therefore 
not  suited  to  bicycle-polo  ;  but  the  more  that 
were  broken  the  more  were  required,  and  his 
commission  agents  reaped  their  harvest.  The 
record,  I  think,  was  taken  by  a  young  secretary 
of  the  British  Legation,  who  successfully  smashed 
six  in  one  afternoon  !  But  it  was  not  at  polo 
alone  that  Mulai  Abdul  Aziz  was  a  skilful  bicyclist, 
for  he  could  perform  a  number  of  tricks  that  would 
almost  have  done  honour  to  a  professional.  I 
have  seen  him  myself  ride  up  a  steep  plank  laid 
against  a  packing-case,  then  along  another  plank 
forming  a  bridge  to  another  packing-case,  and 
down  an  incline  at  the  end  again.  On  one  of  these 
occasions  he  fell,  and  lodged  on  his  head ;  but 
after  being  stunned  for  a  minute  or  two,  remounted 
his  bicycle  and  successfully  accomplished  his  object. 

I  only  once  saw  him  annoyed,  and  it  was  with 
myself.  We  were  standing  on  the  summit  of  an 
old  outer  wall  of  the  palace.  Immediately  beneath 
us,  in  the  shadow  of  the  wall,  were  a  dozen  or  so 
ill-clothed,  half-starved  members  of  what  was  in- 
appropriately called  the  Moorish  Army.  Many  of 
the  little  group  were  evidently  suffering  from 
fever,  very  prevalent  in  Fez  in  summer,  and  alto- 
gether they  formed  a  pitiful  sight. 

I  spoke,  perhaps,  too  warmly  of  the  neglect 
with  which  the  soldiers  were  treated,  of  their 
stolen  pay,  of  their  abject  misery,  and  I  failed 
to  notice  that  the  Sultan  was  not  in  a  mood  at 
that  moment  to  listen  to  my  complaint. 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  101 

"  It  isn't  my  fault,"  he  said  pettishly. 

"  It  is,"  I  replied.  "Your  Majesty  doesn't  take 
the  trouble  to  see  that  your  orders  are  carried 
out." 

The  blood  rushed  to  the  Sultan's  face,  and  he 
drew  himself  up.     "  Remember,"  he  said,  "  you 
are  speaking  to  '  the  Commander  of  the  Faithful,'  ' 
referring  to  his  most  coveted  title. 

"  I  do,"  I  replied,  "  remember  it.  It  is  your 
Majesty  who  forgets  that  these  men  are  '  the 
Faithful.'  " 

Alas  !  as  far  as  he  is  concerned,  but  few  of 
them  were  any  longer  faithful. 

He  bore  me  no  grudge  for  what  I  said,  and  his 
look  of  anger  passed  into  one  of  great  sadness. 
For  a  little  while  he  stood  looking  over  the  great 
plain  that  lay  before  us,  then  turned  and  said 
very  gently,  "  You  don't  know  how  weary  I  am 
of  being  Sultan,"  and  tears  stood  in  his  eyes. 

On  one  occasion  while  visiting  Meknes  with  the 
Sultan,  I  took  the  opportunity  to  go  to  the  Jews' 
quarter  of  the  town,  to  call  on  an  Israelite  family 
who  had  often  hospitably  entertained  me  at  a 
feast  on  previous  visits.  The  lady  of  the  house 
was  an  extremely  portly  dame,  one  might  almost 
say  of  gigantic  proportions,  but  as  kind-hearted 
asjshe  was  large.  I  was  received  with  open  arms 
by  my  host  and  hostess,  their  children  and  grand- 
children, and  after  the  usual  salutations  they 
began  to  pour  out  their  woes.  The  Jews'  quarter 
had  been  raided  by  Berber  tribesmen,  and  my 
friends'  house  and  stables  had  been  broken  into 


102  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

and  robbed.  Could  I  obtain  justice  for  them  ? 
Now,  in  spite  of  the  Sultan's  good  intentions, 
justice  was  about  the  only  thing  in  the  world 
unobtainable  in  Morocco.  The  Sultan,  I  knew, 
would  order  the  damages  to  be  repaid  by  the 
responsible  authorities,  but  my  friends  would 
certainly  receive  only  a  very  small  portion  of 
what  they  had  lost ;  the  rest  would  disappear 
en  route.  I  therefore  determined  to  obtain  justice 
from  the  Sultan  by  a  little  ruse.  I  told  the  portly 
lady  that  His  Majesty  would  make  his  State 
entry  into  the  town  the  following  day,  and  bade 
her  climb  on  to  the  pedestal  of  one  of  the  great 
marble  pillars  of  the  famous  gateway  of  Mansour- 
el-Alj,  and  there  to  await  his  passage.  Immediately 
she  saw  the  Sultan  appear  from  under  the  gateway 
she  was  to  cry,  "  Will  my  Lord  the  Sultan  allow 
me  to  die  in  misery  ?  Will  my  Lord  the  Sultan 
not  protect  me  ?  "  I  told  her  to  look  as  fascinat- 
ing as  possible — she  was  well  on  for  sixty  years 
of  age — and  to  put  on  all  the  finery  of  gold  lace 
and  velvet  to  which  the  Israelite  ladies  of  the 
Moroccan  towns  are  so  partial,  and  which  forms 
their  national  gala  dress. 

She  promised  to  carry  out  my  instructions,  and 
I  laid  my  plans  accordingly.  An  hour  or  two  later 
I  was  received  by  the  Sultan,  and  ventured  to 
remark  that  I  had  experienced  a  curious  dream 
the  night  before.  The  Sultan  asked  me  to  relate 
it,  and  I  replied  that  I  had  dreamed  that  I  was 
accompanying  His  Majesty  on  his  State  entry 
into  the  town,  and  that  just  as  we  passed  under 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  103 

the  famous  gateway  an  enormously  fat  Jewess, 
in  gala  attire,  clinging  to  one  of  the  marble  columns, 
cried  out,  "  Will  my  Lord  the  Sultan  allow  me  to 
die  in  misery  ?  Will  my  Lord  the  Sultan  not 
protect  me  ?  "  The  Sultan  was  by  nature  super- 
stitious, and  wondered  what  my  dream  could 
mean.  Needless  to  say,  I  didn't  inform  him. 

Everything  occurred  as  I  had  planned  it,  with 
one  ludicrous  addition.  The  Sultan  emerged  from 
the  gate,  and  there,  on  the  high  pedestal  of  the 
column,  embracing  the  marble  pillar,  was  my  stout 
friend,  shouting  out  her  petition.  The  Sultan, 
struck  by  the  coincidence,  turned  to  see  if  he  could 
catch  my  eye,  and  I  naturally  looked  as  astonished 
as  he  did.  But  the  lady's  anxiety  to  be  heard  led 
her  to  lean  too  far  forward,  her  hold  on  the  marble 
pillar  was  relaxed,  and  the  last  I  saw  of  her  was 
taking  a  header  into  the  midst  of  scarlet-and-blue 
soldiers  who  lined  the  gateway.  An  hour  later 
messengers  hurried  me  into  the  Sultan's  presence. 
I  found  His  Majesty  all  excitement  at  the  incident, 
and  I  explained  that  no  doubt  my  extraordinary 
dream  was  a  revelation  in  order  that  the  woman 
might  receive  justice.  The  Sultan  asked  me  if  I 
knew  who  she  was. 

"  I  have  seen  her  more  than  once,"  I  replied. 

"  Go  immediately,"  said  His  Majesty,  "  and  find 
out  what  she  wants." 

The  delight  of  my  friends  can  be  imagined  when 
I  entered  their  house  and,  on  behalf  of  the  Sultan, 
asked  for  a  "  statement  of  claim."  I  fully  reported 
the  matter,  and  Mulai  Abdul  Aziz  sent  for  one  of 


104  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

his  own  relations,  Amrani  Shereef,  and  ordered 
him  to  see  that  the  family  were  immediately  re- 
funded for  what  they  had  lost,  and  that  their 
house  should  be  guarded  in  future.  In  this  manner 
I  knew  they  would  get  their  money,  which  they 
certainly  would  not  have  done  had  the  matter 
passed,  in  the  usual  course,  through  the  hands  of 
the  viziers.  The  next  day  they  were  paid,  and  the 
day  after  I  confessed  my  plot  to  the  amused 
Sultan. 

The  year  of  the  Algeciras  Conference  (1906)  I 
was  back  in  Fez  again  after  an  absence  of  three 
years.  Everything  was  changed,  for  the  days  of 
prosperity  and  "  packing-cases  "  were  over,  and 
the  Maghzen  had  fallen  upon  evil  times.  Tribe 
after  tribe  had  thrown  off  their  allegiance.  The 
robbery  and  pilfering  and  corruption  were  worse 
than  ever.  Famine  reigned  in  the  city. 

The  "  campaign  "  which  I,  as  '  Times '  corre- 
spondent, had  carried  on  in  the  '  Times '  during 
the  preceding  year  or  two,  rendered  me  no  persona 
grata  to  the  Sultan  and  his  Court,  and  even  accom- 
modation was  refused  me  and  the  palace  gates 
hermetically  sealed.  I  stayed  for  some  months, 
and  enjoyed,  as  I  have  never  enjoyed  before  or 
since,  the  goodwill  of  the  people  of  Fez.  They 
knew  what  had  happened.  They  knew  that  the 
'  Times '  had  called  the  attention  of  the  world  to 
the  plight  of  their  co-religionists  and  fellow-country- 
men in  Morocco,  and  in  their  suffering  and  misery 
they  showed  an  appreciation  that  was  at  once 
most  marked  and  most  valued.  They  knew  that 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  105 

the  Sultan  had  refused  to  receive  me,  and  that 
the  doors  of  the  viziers'  palaces  were  closed  to 
me ;  and  they  knew,  too,  the  reason — that  I  repre- 
sented a  great  newspaper,  the  columns  of  which 
have  always  been  open  to  the  cries  of  distress  of 
ill-used  and  neglected  peoples,  and  that  their 
plaints  had  already  reached  the  British  public — 
and  the  world's  public — by  these  means.  I  shall 
never  forget  the  sympathy  and  kindness  shown  to 
me  by  the  mass  of  the  inhabitants  at  Fez  at  this 
time.  And  what  was  this  change  that  was  so 
evident  ? 

It  was  famine — that  was  all !  Bread  at  seven- 
pence  a  loaf,  and  the  loaf  the  size  of  a  railway- 
station  bun.  Famine,  because  a  few  of  the  viziers 
•and  officials  had  taken  advantage  of  last  year's 
poor  crops  to  "  corner "  wheat,  by  buying  it 
before  it  entered  the  town,  and  selling  it  at  any 
profit  they  liked ;  famine,  because  the  same  little 
coterie  regulated  the  price  at  which  even  meat 
might  be  sold,  and  alternately  robbed  the  poor 
and  the  butchers ;  famine,  because  every  neces- 
sary of  life  had  to  pass  through  their  hands  before 
it  reached  the  public ;  famine,  because  even 
charcoal,  without  which  no  cooking  can  be  done, 
was  "  cornered."  And  the  caravans  of  camels 
which  should  have  been  bringing  grain  from  the 
coast  to  feed  the  starving  people  were  comman- 
deered to  transport  marble  for  the  floors  of  the 
viziers'  palaces,  built  with  the  proceeds  of  foreign 
loans — and  of  famine. 

Yes,  three  years  had  brought  about  a  change 


106  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

in  Fez,  and  it  was  not  a  change  for  the  better. 
Life  and  energy  seemed  to  have  disappeared. 
The  hang-dog  starving  soldiery,  in  rags  of  course, 
and  paid,  when  they  were  paid  at  all,  sufficiently 
well  to  buy  half  a  small  loaf  of  bread  a  day,  prowled 
to  and  fro  in  the  streets, — such  few,  that  is,  as 
were  left  of  them,  for  the  greater  part  had  long 
ago  deserted  to  the  Pretender,  who  fed  his  men,  or 
had  sold  their  rifles  to  the  nearest  buyer,  and  gone 
back  to  spread  sedition  amongst  the  tribes.  Really 
no  one  can  blame  them,  and  those  that  remained 
would  have  gone  too,  shaking  the  dust  of  Fez 
off  their  shoes — only  they  had  no  shoes,  and  most 
of  them  no  strength  to  walk  the  distance.  The 
streets  were  full  of  starving  and  half-starving 
people,  many  of  whom  begged  only  with  their 
eyes,  too  pitiful  to  look  upon  unmoved.  For  a 
short  time  the  proceeds  of  a  public  subscription 
did  something  to  relieve  these  sufferers,  but  the 
funds  disappeared — into  the  brick  and  mortar  of 
palaces,  it  is  said — and  by,  perhaps,  more  than  a 
coincidence,  the  date  of  the  conclusion  of  the 
Algeciras  Conference  was  also  the  date  at  which 
the  Maghzen  ceased  attempting  to  feed  the  poor. 
Could  it  have  been  that  the  eyes  of  Europe  were 
no  longer  fixed  on  Morocco,  and  therefore  the  poor 
might  starve  again  ?  The  long  lines  of  suffering 
humanity  cringed  back  against  the  walls  of  the 
narrow  streets  to  make  way  for  the  camels,  and 
mules  and  donkeys,  laden  with  marble  and  mosaics 
for  the  palaces  which  the  Court  favourites  were 
building — with  the  money  of  the  people,  with  the 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  107 

proceeds  of  famine.  Before,  the  people  bore  their 
sufferings — for  even  then  they  suffered  enough 
from  the  exactions  of  the  Maghzen,  but  consoled 
themselves  by  saying,  "  Our  Lord  the  Sultan  does 
not  know."  Now  it  was  different.  Famine  had 
rendered  them  a  little — a  very  little — more  cour- 
ageous, and  they  said,  "  Our  Lord  the  Sultan  does 
not  care."  After  all,  there  is  only  the  difference 
of  one  word.  In  the  country  districts  they  went 
a  little — just  a  little — further,  and  said,  "  There 
is  no  Sultan."  It  was  not  true,  of  course,  for 
within  the  crumbling  battlements  of  the  expanse 
of  palace,  Mulai  Abdul  Aziz,  bored  by  everything, 
but  still  kind-hearted,  still  with  the  best  intentions, 
wandered  from  court  to  court  and  from  garden 
to  garden,  giving  orders  that  he  knew  would  never 
be  carried  out,  weary  with  trying  to  do  better 
things,  and  content  to  await  a  change — any 
change — of  circumstances,  with  implicit  trust  in 
God  and  a  lurking  mistrust  in  Europe.  He,  too, 
had  lost  his  energy.  It  was  not  altogether  his 
fault  perhaps  ;  for  at  one  time  he  really  tried, 
and  circumstances  had  been  against  him.  Too 
much  good  nature  and  too  little  determination 
had  led  to  his  failure,  until  he  had  handed  over 
everything  to  men  far  less  capable  and  far  less 
well-intentioned  than  himself,  and  allowed  them 
to  rob  him  as  they  pleased.  He  saw  no  one,  and 
went  nowhere,  probably  because,  with  his  nature, 
he  could  not  but  feel  the  ignominy  of  his  position 
and  the  degradation  of  his  country.  The  palace 
itself  resembled  the  palace  of  a  dream,  haunted 


108  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

by  ghosts.  Yet  even  as  such  it  was  more  fitted 
for  the  residence  of  a  Moorish  Sultan  than  the 
palace  of  three  years  ago,  when  the  courtyards 
were  strewn  with  useless  European  goods,  unsale- 
able for  the  most  part  in  Europe,  and  piled  with 
packing-cases — empty  and  full — and  littered  with 
straw.  Probably  most  of  this  refuse  remained 
there  still — a  poor  return,  after  all,  for  what  was 
expended  on  it. 

The  scene  in  the  great  courtyard,  surrounded 
by  its  columns  and  arches,  in  which  the  Maghzen 
held  its  daily  Court,  was  changed  too.  Under 
their  respective  arcades  the  viziers  sat,  sleepily 
transacting  what  they  called  business — that  is  to 
say,  putting  off  till  to-morrow,  or  longer,  every- 
thing that  they  ought  to  have  done  to-day.  There 
was  no  life,  no  movement,  in  this  Court  now. 
Where  were  the  soldiers,  who,  slovenly  as  they 
were,  added  a  touch  of  colour  to  the  scene  ? 
Where  were  the  country  governors  and  kaids  and 
their  escorts  ?  Where  were  the  officers  of  the 
Court  in  their  white  robes  and  red-peaked  fezes 
— where  were  they  all  ?  And  where  that  active 
lithe  figure  whose  quick  stride  and  energetic 
movements,  whose  keen  eyes  kept  the  whole 
fabric  together — El  Menebhi,  where  was  he  ? 
Gone,  faded  away  like  phantoms,  leaving  to  a 
handful  of  incapable  and  self-seeking  men — whose 
voices  were  mocked  almost  in  their  own  hearing — 
the  misgovernment  of  their  country.  What  wonder 
that  the  people  all  over  Morocco  said,  "  We  have 
no  Sultan."  What  wonder  that  they  disobeyed 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  109 

and  ridiculed  the  Shereefian  commands  !  What 
wonder  that  the  Pretender  and  Raisuli  and  a 
score  of  others  had  arisen  all  over  the  country  ! 
No,  the  only  wonder  is  that  the  population  had 
not  rebelled  in  a  body.  But  they  had  no  need  to 
do  so.  They  paid  no  taxes  and  acknowledged  no 
government.  As  to  the  townspeople,  years  of 
extortion  and  suffering  had  crushed  their  spirit 
— though  they  knew  that  all  the  present  regime 
was  giving  them  was  famine.  ^ 

And  Mulai  Abdul  Aziz,  knowing  something  of 
all  this — knowing,  anyhow,  enough  to  make  him 
desirous  of  knowing  no  more — still  talked  of  what 
he  intended  to  do  for  his  people,  still  poured 
out  plans  for  their  betterment  into  the  ears  of 
men  whose  one  object  was  to  frustrate  them, 
and  wandered  aimlessly  from  court  to  court  and 
from  garden  to  garden  inside  the  palace  precincts 
— a  kind  intelligent  gentleman,  too  good  in  many 
ways,  and  too  weak  in  many  more,  for  the  arduous 
position  he  had  been  called  upon  to  fill.  If  the 
Pope  was  a  prisoner  in  the  Vatican,  the  Sultan  of 
Morocco  was  doubly  so  in  the  palace  of  Fez. 

Yet  these  changes,  such  as  they  were,  could  be 
apparent  only  to  those  very  familiar  with  Fez  in 
former  days.  To  all  others  the  city  must  be  the 
same  as  ever,  with  its  narrow  tortuous  streets 
overhung  by,  and  tunnelled  through,  the  high 
projecting  houses  ;  full  of  gloom  and  mystery ; 
with  glimpses,  here  of  orange-trees  peeping  over 
a  high  wall ;  there,  of  tiled  minarets  and  the 
green  roofs  of  mosques  and  tombs — a  city  that 


110  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

extends  not  a  yard  beyond  the  walls  that  encircle 
it.  Within,  a  tortuous  maze  ;  without,  mile  upon 
mile  of  open  country  dotted  by  the  thatch  huts 
and  tent  villages  of  the  tribes.  Yet  close  to  the 
walls,  along  the  banks  of  the  river  that  flows  in 
so  many  channels  through  and  around  the  town, 
have  sprung  up  gardens  of  oranges  and  olives,  of 
mulberries,  apricots,  and  vines,  that  form  a  setting 
of  richer  green  to  the  grey  white  city  that  meanders 
down  from  the  plain  to  the  valley  of  the  Sebou, 
following  all  the  way  the  form  of  the  depression 
in  which  it  lies. 

There  is  scarcely  a  view  of  Fez  that  is  not 
beautiful,  scarcely  a  glimpse  that  is  not  sad. 
Its  very  colouring,  or  perhaps  lack  of  colouring; 
its  amazing  alleys  into  which  the  sun  never  shines  ; 
its  ruined  mosques,  rich  in  fast-falling  mosaics 
and  wood-carving,  in  rotting  arabesques  and  grass- 
grown  roofs ;  its  damaged  drinking  fountains, 
from  the  broken  tiles  of  which  the  water  still 
splashes  to  where  once  a  basin  caught  it,  but  now 
only  to  form  a  channel  of  mud  in  the  narrow 
thoroughfare  ;  its  stately  caravanserais  with  their 
galleries  of  arches  and  trellis  of  wood  that  has 
turned  purple  and  grey  with  age ;  its  garden 
quarter  from  which  rise  the  modern  palaces  of 
the  viziers,  built  with  the  people's  money  and  the 
people's  food — all  add  a  mysterious  charm  to  a 
city  that  stands  alone  as  an  unspoiled  example  of 
former  prosperity  and  existing  decay. 

So  it  is  with  the  people.  They  wore  the  de- 
spondent sad  expression  that  came  from  years  of 


[Service  des  Beaux- Arts,  Morocco. 
MEDERSA    OF    ATTARINE,     FEZ. 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  111 

oppression — hopeless  of  the  future,  forgetful  of 
the  past,  and  yet  with  one  solace  left  to  them, 
and  one  only :  that  God  had  ordained  it  so. 
Nothing  would  shake  their  belief  that  all  was 
predestined,  unalterably  predestined  and  inscribed 
beforehand,  hi  their  book  of  life.  "It  is  written  " 
— and  for  them  that  was  enough. 

While  the  Powers  of  Europe  had  been  almost 
on  the  verge  of  war  over  Morocco,  while  the  eyes 
of  the  world's  public  had  been  fixed  upon  the 
Conference  of  Algeciras,  while  there  still  lay 
before  the  country  a  future  that  was  unknown, 
while  one-fifth  of  the  land  was  in  the  hands  of  the 
Pretender,  while  the  Sultan's  authority  scarcely 
extended  outside  a  few  walled  cities — Fez  had 
remained  unmoved.  Fatalists  one  and  all,  the 
Sultan  and  his  viziers,  the  townspeople  and  the 
starving  poor  had  scarcely  given  a  serious  thought 
to  the  future — to  the  crisis  through  which  their 
country  had  passed,  and  was  still  passing.  Mulai 
Abdul  Aziz  wandered  from  garden  to  garden  and 
court  to  court  inside  the  palace  walls.  His  viziers 
still  frustrated  the  good  intentions  of  His  Majesty 
— there  was  but  little  majesty  left  except  in  name 
— and  the  people  still  starved ;  and  one  and 
all,  firm  in  their  unshakable  belief,  said  "It  is 
written." 

The  results  of  the  Conference  of  Algeciras  and 
of  the  "  Acte  "  which  promulgated  its  decisions 
were  what  might  have  been  expected.  All  Europe 
sent  its  delegates  to  the  pleasant  little  Spanish 
town  lying  a  few  miles  from  Gibraltar,  and  every 


112  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

Government  had  an  axe  to  grind.  They  poured 
new  wine — vinegar  most  of  it — into  old  skins,  and 
the  result  was  inevitable.  While  the  special 
Ambassadors,  whose  titles  fill  a  couple  of  pages 
of  print  in  the  tiny  volume  that  contains  the 
*"  Acte,"  were  discussing  Public  Works,  Inter- 
national Police,  the  State  Bank,  and  the  differences 
between  "  fusils  rayes  et  non-ray  es  " — and  a  host 
of  other  things — Morocco  was  sinking  deeper  and 
deeper  into  a  state  of  anarchy,  rendered  more 
hopeless  than  ever  by  the  rumours  which  were 
circulated  amongst  the  tribes  as  to  what  was 
occurring  on  the  other  side  of  the  Straits  of 
Gibraltar.  From  the  hills  above  Algeciras  on  at 
least  one  occasion  the  smoke  of  burning  villages 
in  the  Tangier  district — the  result  of  this  anarchy 
— was  clearly  visible.  Raisuli  was  supreme  in  the 
north,  while  to  the  east  of  Fez  the  Pretender, 
Bou  Hamara,  still  held  his  own. 

4  Bou  Hamara  was  a  native  of  the  Zarhoun  tribe, 
who  had  been  employed  at  one  time  as  a  scribe 
by  a  high  native  functionary  of  Meknes.  His 
conduct,  however,  had  rendered  him  quite  un- 
suitable to  be  maintained  as  a  secretary,  for  he 
not  only,  so  rumour  says,  forged  his  master's 
signature,  but  also  caused  a  replica  of  the  Imperial 
Seal  to  be  made,  by  which  he  obtained  a  consider- 
able grant  of  money.  He  had  also  in  his  spare 
moments  learned  a  few  simple  conjuring  tricks. 
Already  known  as  a  scholar  and  a  devout  Moslem, 
these  other  acquirements  stood  him  in  good  stead. 
But  he  was  found  out,  and  left  Meknes  hurriedly. 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  113 

Living  on  his  wits,  he  made  for  the  Taza  districts, 
situated  between  Fez  and  the  Algerian  frontier, 
and  there  acquired,  from  his  scholarship  and  his 
conjuring,  a  very  considerable  prestige.  Almost 
unconsciously  he  was  accepted  as  a  "  leader," 
and  eventually  declared  himself  to  be  Mulai 
Mohamed,  the  eldest  son  of  the  late  Sultan, 
Mulai  Hassen,  and  therefore  the  elder  brother 
of  the  reigning  monarch,  Mulai  Abdul  Aziz.  He 
caused  a  great  Seal  of  State  to  be  struck,  and  was 
proclaimed  as  Sultan.  Mention  has  already  been 
made  of  the  defeat  the  troops  of  Mulai  Abdul  Aziz 
suffered  at  his  hands  in  December  1902.  His 
prestige  had  now  reached  its  zenith,  and  caused 
the  greatest  anxiety  to  the  Moorish  Court.  He 
ruled  Eastern  Morocco  for  several  years  with 
scarcely  varying  success.  At  times,  it  is  true,  he 
was  driven  back  into  the  mountains  of  the  Rif 
when  Taza  was  captured  by  a  Moorish  army  under 
El-Menebhi,  the  active  young  Minister  of  War ; 
but  Bou  Hamara  was  always  able  to  reassert  his 
authority  and  regain  his  lost  possessions.  In  spite 
of  every  effort  of  El-Menebhi  to  maintain  an 
adequate  force,  the  corruption  and  incapacity  of 
the  Court  was  such  that  even  his  energy  could 
avail  nothing.  The  soldiers'  pay  failed,  and  the 
Sultan's  troops  melted  away.  It  was  not  until 
Mulai  Hafid  had  come  to  the  throne  in  1912, 
after  the  abdication  of  Mulai  Abdul  Aziz,  that  Bou 
Hamara  was  captured  and  brought  to  Fez.  Con- 
fined in  a  cage  carried  on  the  back  of  a  camel, 
the  famous  Pretender  was  brought  into  the 

H 


114  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

Sultan's  presence.  The  interview  was  protracted. 
For  several  days  Bou  Hamara,  squatting  in  the 
small  space  of  his  cage,  was  exposed  to  public 
view  in  the  great  court  of  the  palace  where  the 
Sultan  held  his  receptions — and  the  Sovereign 
who  held  the  throne  and  the  Pretender  who  had 
so  long  threatened  it  were  face  to  face.  Eventually 
the  prisoner  of  State  was  put  into  the  lions'  cage 
in  the  presence  of  the  Sultan,  while  the  ladies  of 
the  Court  lined  the  roof  of  the  palace  to  witness 
the  execution.  The  lions,  however,  too  well  fed, 
refused  to  eat  him,  but  mangled  one  of  his  arms. 
After  waiting  for  some  time  longer  to  see  if  the 
king  of  beasts  would  change  their  minds,  the  Sultan 
ordered  the  Pretender  to  be  shot,  and  he  was 
despatched  by  the  slaves.  His  body  was  after- 
wards burnt,  to  deprive  him  of  any  possibility 
— for  the  Moors  believe  in  a  corporeal  resurrection 
— of  going  to  heaven.  Terrible  as  was  his  end, 
Bou  Hamara  himself  had  been  guilty  of  every 
kind  of  atrocity,  and  had  regularly  burnt,  after 
sprinkling  them  with  petroleum,  any  of  the 
Sultan's  soldiers  that  he  had  been  able  to  capture 
during  his  campaigns. 

The  vicinity  of  the  Pretender's  jurisdiction  to 
the  Spanish  port  of  Melilla,  on  the  Rif  coast,  had 
seriously  inconvenienced  the  Spanish  authorities 
and  inhabitants  of  that  town ;  and  at  length,  in 
order  to  obtain  supplies  for  the  population,  the 
Spaniards  had  been  obliged  to  negotiate  and  to 
enter  into  direct  relations  with  him.  A  mining- 
engineer  told  me  that  he  had  once  accompanied 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  115 

some  Spanish  capitalists  on  a  visit  to  Bou  Hamara's 
headquarters  at  Selouan.  They  all  went  with  a 
certain  fear  and  trembling,  but  the  stake  was  a  big 
one.  They  wanted  to  obtain  a  concession  for  the 
working  of  some  valuable  iron-mines  in  the  neigh- 
bourhood. The  Pretender  received  them  cordially 
enough,  and  invited  them  to  sit  down  with  him 
on  a  large  carpet  spread  in  the  shadow  of  a  tree. 
The  discussion  of  the  terms  of  the  concession 
proceeded,  and  Bou  Hamara's  demands  became 
more  and  more  exacting.  The  capitalists  hesitated 
and  protested,  but  were  brought  to  acceptance 
by  the  fact  that  while  the  conversation  was  still 
in  progress  a  number  of  the  Pretender's  soldiers 
arrived  carrying  the  recently-severed  heads  of  a 
dozen  or  so  of  his  enemies,  which  they  arranged 
round  the  edge  of  the  carpet.  At  the  end  of  the 
interview  the  three  or  four  very  pale  capitalists 
had  accepted  in  their  entirety  the  Pretender's 
propositions,  and  were  thanking  him  for  his 
cordial  reception,  surrounded  by  the  ghastly  ex- 
hibition that  had  n£>t  a  little  influenced  their 
decision. 

The  heads  of  enemies  were,  until  the  end  of 
Mulai  Hafid's  reign,  commonly  exposed  upon  the 
gates  of  the  towns  of  the  interior  of  Morocco. 
In  1909,  during  the  official  Mission  of  the  late 
Sir  Reginald  Lister  to  Fez,  the  Bab  Mharouk  was 
hung  with  the  heads  of  rebels.  One  of  these  grisly 
monuments  fell,  with  a  resounding  thud,  as  the 
British  Minister  and  some  of  his  party  were  passing 
underneath.  The  manner  of  affixing  them  was 


116  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

by  passing  a  wire  through  the  ear,  which  was 
fastened  to  a  nail  in  the  wall.  Over  and  over  again 
during  my  long  residence  in  Morocco  I  have  seen 
the  gates  and  other  buildings  at  the  Moorish  capitals 
decorated  with  these  horrid  trophies. 

\  A  more  serious  rival  to  the  Sultan  Abdul  Aziz 
came  upon  the  scene  when  Mulai  Hafid,  his  half- 
brother,  set  up  the  banner  of  revolt  in  Southern 
Morocco  in  1908,  and  proclaimed  himself  Sultan. 
The  moment  was  opportune.  The  previous  year 
(1907)  the  French  had  bombarded  Casablanca — 
after  the  massacre  of  a  number  of  European 
workmen  by  the  natives.  These  workmen,  Italians 
and  Frenchmen,  were  engaged  upon  the  quarrying 
and  transport  of  stone  for  the  construction  of  the 

Nport.  The  little  railway  used  for  this  purpose 
passed  through,  or  close  to,  a  Moslem  cemetery. 
Native  opinion,  excited  by  religious  agitators, 
burst  all  bounds  of  restraint,  and  the  Moors 
attacked  the  train.  The  labourers  returning  from 
their  work  were  murdered.  A  French  warship 
arrived  on  the  scene,  and  an  armed  party  landed 
for  the  protection  of  the  European  population  of 
the  town.  The  forts  and  native  official  quarters 
were  at  the  same  time  bombarded.  Scenes  of  the 
wildest  confusion  ensued,  for  not  only  was  the 
town  under  the  fire  of  the  cannon  of  the  warship, 
but  the  tribes  from  the  interior  had  taken  advan- 
tage of  the  panic  to  invade  and  pillage  the  place. 
Every  sort  of  atrocity  and  horror  was  perpetrated, 
and  Casablanca  was  a  prey  to  loot  and  every  kind 
of  crime.  The  European  force  was  sufficient  to 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  117 

protect  the  Consulates,  and  the  greater  part  of 
the  Christian  population  escaped  murder.  When 
order  was  restored  the  town  presented  a  pitiful 
aspect.  I  saw  it  a  very  few  days  after  the  bom- 
bardment, and  the  scene  was  indescribable — a 
confusion  of  dead  people  and  horses,  while  the 
contents  of  almost  every  house  seemed  to  have 
been  hurled  into  the  streets  and  destroyed.  The 
looting  was  incomplete :  piles  of  cotton  goods, 
cases  of  foodstuffs — in  fact,  every  class  of  mer- 
chandise still  lay  strewn  about  the  roads.  Many 
of  the  houses  had  been  burned  and  gutted.  Out 
of  dark  cellars,  Moors  and  Jews,  hidden  since  the 
first  day  of  the  bombardment,  many  of  them 
wounded,  were  creeping,  pale  and  terrified.  Some 
had  to  be  dug  out  of  the  ruins  of  their  abodes. 
Over  all  this  mass  of  destruction  horses  and  men 
had  galloped  and  fought.  Blood  was  everywhere. 
In  what  had  once  been  the  poorer  quarter  of  the 
town,  where  the  houses,  mostly  thatched  in  straw, 
had  been  burned,  I  only  met  one  living  soul — a 
mad  woman,  dishevelled,  dirty,  but  smiling — -who 
kept  calling,  "  Ayesha,  my  little  daughter ;  my 
little  son  Ahmed,  where  are  you :  I  am  calling  you." 
Turning  to  me  she  asked,  "  You  haven't  seen  my 
little  children,  have  you  ? — a  little  girl  and  a  tiny 
boy,  almost  a  baby."  She  didn't  wait  for  an 
answer,  but  passed  on,  still  calling  Ayesha  and 
Ahmed. 

There  were  many  people  completely  mad  with 
fear.  The  Jews  and  Jewesses  were  perhaps  those 
who  suffered  the  most.  One  Jewess,  rescued  from 


118  MOROCCO   THAT  WAS 

a  cellar,  was  brought,  stunned  with  terror,  to 
Tangier  on  a  relief  ship.  It  was  only  after  landing 
that  she  remembered  that  she  had  hidden  her 
baby,  to  save  it  from  death,  in  a  corner  of  the 
cellar  where  she  had  been  concealed — three  days 
before. 

The  bombardment  of  Casablanca  and  those  days 
of  horror  necessitated  a  campaign  to  clear  the  sur- 
rounding country  of  the  evil  tribes  that  hovered 
about,  waiting  another  occasion  to  murder,  rape, 
and  pillage.  ^Ll£M--tbe  beginning  of  the  French

V. 

THE   LIQUIDATION   OF   THE   SULTANATE. 

THE  year  1912  saw  the  end  of  the  independence  of 
Morocco,  and  though  there  must  always  be  present 
a  regret  when  something  very  old  and  picturesque 
disappears,  yet,  on  the  whole,  the  end  of  its 
independence  was  a  matter  for  congratulation. 

Built  up  originally  on  the  foundation  of  the 
religious  prestige  of  its  rulers — for  the  Sultans  of 
Morocco  were  descendants  of  the  Prophet — the 
rotten  old  edifice  had  stood  for  many  years  in  a 
state  of  imminent  collapse.  Only  its  isolation, 
and  the  exclusiveness  and  fanaticism  of  its  people, 
had  postponed  its  earlier  disintegration,  and  for 
a  long  time,  in  the  throes  of  mortal  disease,  Morocco 
had  kept  up  a  semblance  of  life.  A  young  and 
spendthrift  Sultan,  Mulai  Abdul  Aziz,  had  wasted 
the  revenues  of  the  country  and  emptied  its 
Treasuries — for  the  greater  part  on  the  most  use- 
less purchases  of  European  origin.  His  reign  had 
been  the  epoch  of  the  commis  voyageurs,  when 
caravans  converged  upon  Fez  from  all  the  seaports, 
bearing  cages  of  wild  beasts,  and  the  most  astound- 
ing assortment  of  every  imaginable  and  unpractical 


120  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

object  of  luxury  and  bad  taste.  It  was  the  time 
of  fireworks  and  barrel-organs,  of  fantastic  uniforms 
and  beds  made  of  looking-glass,  of  cameras  and 
parrots  from  the  Amazons.  This  expenditure,  his 
association  with  Europeans,  and  the  weakness  with 
which  he  administered  his  Government,  gave  rise 
to  a  rebellion.  His  half-brother,  Mulai  Hafid,  pro- 
claimed himself  Sultan  in  the  southern  capital. 

The  war  between  the  two  Sultans  was  tedi- 
ous and  uninteresting.  The  principal  object  of 
both  seemed  to  be  how  to  avoid  an  encounter, 
and  they  contented  themselves  by  issuing  edicts  of 
mutual  excommunication,  and,  in  order  to  obtain 
money,  by  pillaging  the  tribes,  regardless  of  their 
political  opinions.  When  either  Sultan  had  funds 
he  had  also  soldiers ;  failing  resources,  the  armies 
alternately  dwindled  away  almost  to  the  point  of 
disappearance.  In  fact,  both  were  dependent  for 
troops  on  deserters  from  each  other's  forces. 

In  1908  Mulai  Abdul  Aziz  left  Fez  for  the  scene 
of  the  rebellion,  and  marching  slowly  by  a  very 
devious  course,  so  as  to  avoid  any  possible  en- 
counter with  the  enemy,  he  set  out  for  the  south. 
Meanwhile  Mulai  Hafid,  equally  pluckily,  set  out 
to  conquer  the  north — also,  and  for  the  same 
reason,  by  a  very  devious  route.  In  all  probability 
each  would  have  successfully  reached  the  other's 
capital  without  a  hitch,  if  Mulai  Abdul  Aziz's 
army,  when  only  a  short  distance  from  its  goal, 
Marrakesh,  had  not  suddenly  pillaged  the  Imperial 
camp,  driven  the  Sultan  to  seek  refuge,  after  a 
long  and  dangerous  journey,  on  the  coast,  and 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  121 

declared  for  his  rival.  A  few  months  later  he 
abdicated  in  favour  of  Mulai  Hafid,  who,  with  only 
a  few  followers,  for  his  army  had  likewise  deserted 
him,  had  meanwhile  arrived  in  Fez  with  little 
more  than  the  proverbial  half-crown  in  his 
pocket. 

Fez  accepted  him  as  Sultan,  on  the  distinct 
condition  that  the  city  was  to  be  exempted  from 
all  taxation.  This  His  Majesty  solemnly  promised 
— and  he  kept  his  promise  for  a  few  weeks,  until, 
in  fact,  he  was  strong  enough  to  break  it — and 
then  he  collected  taxes,  legal  and  illegal,  with 
gusto  never  before  experienced. 

His  ability  to  act  thus  was  owing  to  his  having 
meanwhile  collected  a  little  army.  Naturally  the 
Treasury  was  empty,  and  no  tribesmen  presented 
themselves  as  desiring  to  take  military  service,  as 
no  pay  was  forthcoming.  The  situation  was  pre- 
carious. Without  troops  Mulai  Hafid  could  do 
nothing,  not  even  collect  the  taxes  he  had  promised 
to  forgo ;  and  without  the  taxes  he  couldn't  live. 
At  all  costs  he  must  have  an  army. 

So  one  morning  the  public  criers  announced  in 
the  streets  and  market-places  that  the  Sultan  was 
on  a  certain  day  giving  a  great  feast  at  the  palace 
to  the  adepts  of  the  sect  of  the  "  Gennaoua." 
Now  the  confraternity  of  the  "  Gennaoua "  is 
very  popular  in  Morocco,  though — limited  almost 
entirely  to  the  Southerners,  who  are  largely  of 
negro  extraction,  and  form  a  class  by  themselves 
of  labourers  and  water-carriers — it  is  looked  upon 
as  unorthodox  by  the  more  educated  Moors.  The 


122  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

Sultan  even  hinted  that  he  himself  had  leanings 
towards  their  particular  doctrine. 

On  the  day  in  question  the  "  Gennaoua,"  washed 
and  in  their  best  clothes,  flocked  to  the  palace, 
and  entered  its  great  walled  courts,  surrounded  by 
frowning  towers.  With  every  sign  of  holiday- 
making  and  joy,  they  manifested  their  pleasure 
at  the  honour  of  being  invited  to  the  Sultan's 
religious-garden-party — and  sought  refreshments. 
Alas  !  there  were  none — nothing  but  high  walls  and 
closed  gates — and  the  next  day  a  sad  but  resigned 
army  was  being  drilled  on  the  palace  parade-ground. 

Mulai  Hafid  was  not  the  man  to  restore  the  dying 
Morocco  back  to  health.  Tribes  revolted ;  he 
himself  adopted  barbarous  methods,  and  the  con- 
dition of  Morocco  became  worse  than  before.  In 
the  early  months  of  1912  the  Sultan  was  besieged 
by  the  tribes  in  Fez.  He  appealed  to  the  French, 
already  installed  at  Casablanca  on  the  Atlantic 
coast.  An  expedition  was  hurriedly  despatched 
to  the  capital,  which  was  relieved,  and  a  few 
weeks  later  the  Treaty  of  the  French  Protectorate 
was  signed,  to  be  followed  immediately  by  a 
massacre  of  French  officers  and  civilians  in  Fez. 
Mulai  Hafid' s  position  became  impossible,  both 
in  the  eyes  of  France  and  of  his  own  people,  and 
he  decided  to  abdicate.  The  Court  moved  to 
Rabat,  on  the  coast,  and  there  the  final  scenes 
of  Moroccan  independence  took  place.  They  con- 
sisted in  the  most  rapacious  bargaining  on  the 
part  of  the  Sultan,  in  order  to  obtain  the  best 
possible  terms  for  himself. 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  123 

Before  leaving  Fez  he  had  already  begun  to  se- 
cure his  future  comfort  in  life.  He  had  informed 
all  the  royal  ladies  of  his  palace — and  they  were 
legion — the  widows  of  former  Sultans  and  a  host 
of  female  relations — that  they  must  all  accompany 
him  to  Rabat.  He  gave  them  stringent  orders 
as  to  their  luggage.  All  their  jewels  and  valuables 
were  to  be  packed  in  small  cases,  then"  clothes 
and  less  costly  belongings  in  trunks.  They  strictly 
followed  these  injunctions,  but  on  the  day  of  the 
Sultan's  departure  the  ladies  and  the  trunks  were 
left  behind.  They  are  still  in  Fez  :  the  jewels, 
there  is  reason  to  believe,  are  in  Europe.  Mulai 
Hafid  always  prided  himself  on  his  business 
qualities. 

The  last  weeks  of  his  reign  were  one  continual 
period  of  wrangling  with  the  French  authorities. 
He  was  still  Sultan  and  therefore  dangerous,  and 
the  question  of  his  successor  had  not  been  settled, 
so  he  yet  held  some  trump  cards,  which  he  played 
successfully.  Even  when  everything  was  arranged, 
and  the  letters  for  the  proclamation  of  his  younger 
half-brother,  Mulai  Youssef,  the  reigning  Sultan, 
had  been  despatched  to  the  interior,  Mulai  Hafid 
changed  his  mind.  On  reconsideration,  he  stated, 
he  thought  he  wouldn't  abdicate  or  leave  the 
country,  as  had  been  decided.  He  had  already 
obtained  the  most  generous  terms  from  the  French 
Government,  but  the  situation  was  desperate. 
Instructions  had  already  been  circulated  in  the 
interior  to  proclaim  the  new  Sovereign,  and  the 
reigning  one  refused  to  abdicate  !  Then  Mulai 


124  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

Hafid  said  that  possibly  he  might  be  persuaded 
again  to  change  his  mind.  He  was  ;  but  it  cost 
another  £40^000,  which  was  given  him  in  a  cheque 
as  he  left  the  quay  at  Rabat  for  the  French  cruiser 
that  was  to  take  him  on  a  visit  to  France.  In 
exchange,  he  handed  to  the  French  Resident-General 
the  final  document  of  his  abdication.  The  mutual 
confidence  between  these  two  personages  was  such 
that  for  a  spell  they  stood  each  holding  an  end 
of  the  two  documents,  and  each  afraid  to  let 
go  of  his  lest  the  other  paper  should  not  be 
delivered. 

The  night  before  the  signing  of  his  official 
abdication  Mulai  Hafid  destroyed  the  sacred  em- 
blems of  the  Sultanate  of  Morocco — for  he  realised 
that  he  was  the  last  independent  Sovereign  of 
that  country,  and  was  determined  that  with  its 
independence  these  historical  emblems  should  dis- 
appear too.  He  burnt  the  crimson  parasol  which 
on  occasions  of  State  had  been  borne  over  his 
head.  The  palanquin  he  hewed  in  pieces  and 
consigned  also  to  the  flames,  together  with  the 
two  cases  in  which  certain  holy  books  were  carried. 
The  books  themselves  he  spared.  The  family 
jewels  he  took  with  him. 

From  Rabat,  Mulai  Hafid  proceeded  to  France, 
where,  as  the  guest  of  the  French  Government, 
and  travelling  in  semi-state,  he  made  a  protracted 
tour.  At  the  conclusion  of  this  journey  he  returned 
to  Tangier,  where  his  immediate  family  and  re- 
tainers— in  all  about  160  persons — had  meanwhile 
arrived.  The  old  Kasbah  (castle)  was  placed  at 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  125 

His  Majesty's  disposal,  and  there  he  took  up  his 
residence. 

Almost  immediately  after  his  arrival  at  Tangier 
began  the  discussion  of  the  terms  of  his  abdication, 
for  only  its  more  general  lines  had  been  settled 
at  Rabat,  and  in  a  very  sTTort  time  the  ex-Sultan's 
relations  with  the  French  were  seriously  embroiled. 
Mulai  Hafid  did  not  apparently  regret  having 
abdicated.  He  knew  that  his  continued  presence 
on  the  throne  in  the  actual  circumstances  was  out 
of  the  question.  What  he  did  regret  was  that  he 
had  not  made  better  terms  for  himself,  and  he 
still  hoped  to  be  able  to  extort  more  money  and 
more  properties.  Thus  the  negotiations  were  being 
carried  on  by  him  in  a  spirit  of  grasping  meanness, 
that  rendered  any  solution  impossible.  At  the 
beginning  of  his  reign,  only  four  years  before,  he 
had  shown  signs  of  an  elevated  and  patriotic 
spirit,  and  really  intended  to  do  his  best  to  main- 
tain the  independence  of  the  country.  But  he 
had  quickly  realised  how  impossible  his  self-set 
task  was.  He  became  unscrupulous,  neurasthenic, 
and  cruel.  He  made  enemies  on  every  side — 
amongst  his  own  people  by  his  barbarities  and  his 
extortions,  and  amongst  the  Europeans  by  his 
cynicism  and  intransigence. 

So  it  came  about  that  in  a  very  short  time  after 
his  arrival  in  Tangier  his  relations  with  the  French 
authorities  were  strained  to  breaking-point.  It  was 
at  this  moment,  when  everything  seemed  almost 
hopeless,  that  the  writer  was  asked,  independently 
by  both  sides,  to  intervene  in  the  interests  of  peace. 


126  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

This  invitation  to  intervene  came  about  as 
follows.  There  had  been  a  terrible  scene  between 
the  ex-Sultan  and  the  French  authority  charged 
with  the  negotiations,  and  Mulai  Hafid  had  used 
language  so  unparliamentary  that  any  further 
meeting  was  out  of  the  question. 

Early  one  morning  the  writer  received  the  visit 
of  a  French  official,  who  implored  him  to  become 
the  medium  of  the  conversations  and  proposals, 
paying  him  the  compliment  of  saying  that  he 
seemed  to  be  the  only  person  who  had  any  influence 
over  the  ex-Sultan,  whose  conduct  was  bitterly 
resented  in  high  quarters. 

Scarcely  had  this  person  disappeared  when  the 
ex-Sultan  himself  arrived.  His  nerves  appeared 
to  have  completely  given  way,  and  he  was  in  a 
state  of  the  deepest  depression.  Throwing  himself 
upon  a  sofa,  and  in  tears,  he  poured  out  all  his 
woes,  real  and  pretended,  attacking  the  French 
with  a  vehemence  that  was  as  violent  as  it  was 
unjust.  "  You,"  he  said  to  the  writer,  "  seem  to 
be  the  only  person  who  has  any  influence  upon 
these  villains.  Will  you  continue  the  negotia- 
tions ? "  Under  the  circumstances  there  was 
nothing  to  do  but  to  accept. 

An  hour  later  the  conversations  had  recom- 
menced. The  ex-Sultan  spent  the  whole  day  at 
the  writer's  villa,  and  could  scarcely  be  persuaded 
to  eat  or  drink.  During  the  writer's  absence  at 
the  French  Legation,  Mulai  Hafid  took  his  de- 
parture— and  that  was  not  all  he  took,  for  he  car- 
ried away  with  him  ths^choicest  specimens  of  the 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  127 

writer's  Arabic  manuscripts.  Being  of  a  literary 
disposition,  the  temptation  of  the  illuminated 
books  was  too  great.  The  writer  never  saw  them 
again,  but  it  is  only  fair  to  state  that  His  Majesty 
sent  a  present  in  exchange  the  same  evening — a, 
gold  and  enamelled  dagger. 

During  the  following  weeks  the  principal  points 
of  the  negotiations  were  successfully  solved — the 
question  of  the  pension,  funds  for  the  construction 
of  a  palace  in  xangief,  the  retention  of  certain 
large  properties  in  the  interior,  and  the  future  of 
the  ex-Sultan's  wives  and  children. 

Then  came  the  question  of  the  debts,  about 
which  there  ensued  a  long  and  acrimonious  dis- 
cussion. It  had  been  accepted  on  principle  that 
all  debts  that  had  been  incurred  directly,  and  in 
certain  cases  indirectly,  in  the  interests  of  the 
State,  should  be  considered  as  Governmental  debts, 
and  be  paidj^  the  French  Protectorate  Govern- 
ment, while  all  private  debts  should  be  settled  out 
of  the  ex-Sultan's  private  fortune. 

Now  this  distinction  of  debts  was  rendered 
extremely  difficult  by  the  systems  under  which 
Morocco  had  been  governed.  The  Sultan  of 
Morocco  was  always  an  absolute  monarch,  and, 
as  such,  the  revenues  of  the  country  were  his. 
There  had  never  been  any  distinction  between 
public  funds  and  private  funds — all  belonged  to 
the  Sultan.  As  a  rule,  the  expenses  of  the  State, 
as  well  as  the  palace  upkeep,  were  paid  by  bills 
drawn  upon  the  custom-houses  of  the  coast.  It 
was  therefore  no  easy  task  to  arrive  at  an  agree- 


128  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

ment  as  to  what  were  State  and  what  private 
debts,  so  inextricably  mixed  had  they  been  in  the 
past. 

There  was,  for  instance,  a  bill  for  a  fine  marble 
staircase,  ordered  in  Italy  for  the  palace  at  Fez. 
The  French  authorities  argued  that  this  very 
expensive  staircase  was  merely  a  piece  of  wild 
extravagance  on  the  part  of  Mulai  Hafid,  and  that 
accordingly  he  ought  to  pay  for  it.  The  ex-Sultan, 
on  the  contrary,  insisted  that  the  palace  was  the 
property  of  the  State — he  had  argued  just  the 
other  way  when  he  had  been  called  upon  to  explain 
why  he  had  brought  away  with  him  certain  valu- 
able fixtures — and  that  any  additions  and  improve- 
ments he  had  made  to  it  were  all  to  the  advantage 
and  interests  of  the  State.  It  was,  he  said,  his 
successor  and  not  he  himself  who  would  benefit 
by  the  marble  staircase.  The  Protectorate  Govern- 
ment allowed  the  justice  of  this  argument  and 
paid  the  bill. 

The  sequel  to  this  incident  is  worth  the  telling. 
A  few  months  later,  when  the  ex-Sultan  was 
signing  a  contract  for  the  construction  of  his  new 
palace  at  Tangier,  he  eliminated  one  of  the  several 
marble  staircases  marked  in  the  plan.  He  had, 
he  said,  a  very  superior  marble  stair  which  would 
do  admirably  in  its  place.  The  writer  ventured  to 
ask  if  it  was  the  same  one  about  which  there  had 
been  so  much  discussion.  "  It  is,"  replied  Mulai 
Hafid.  "  You  see,  it  had  not  yet  left  Italy,  so  I 
telegraphed  and  had  it  delivered  here  instead  of 
being  sent  to  Fez." 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  129 

A  still  more  complicated  claim  was  for  some 
hundreds  of  yards  of  very  expensive  and  very  fine 
crimson  cloth.  Naturally  the  Protectorate  author- 
ities scheduled  this  amongst  the  private  debts. 
The  Sultan  protested.  The  cloth,  he  said,  had  been 
purchased  for  Governmental  purposes — in  fact,  for 
the  trousers  of  the  Imperial  kitchen-maids — for 
there  are  several  hundred  slave-women  employed 
in  preparing  the  palace  food.  The  Protectorate 
Government  refused  to  be  responsible  for  this 
debt.  The  ex-Sultan  drew  up  an  historical  treatise 
to  prove  that  Imperial  kitchen-maids  were  part 
and  parcel  of  the  State,  and  passed,  like  the  palace 
itself,  from  Sultan  to  Sultan.  The  principle  was 
accepted,  but  the  debt  was  disallowed,  on  the 
ground  that  these  good  ladies  did  not  require  such 
expensive  stuff  for  their  nether  garments.  A  cotton 
material,  they  argued,  would  have  equally  well 
served  the  purpose.  The  Sultan's  reply  was 
unanswerable  and  crushing.  "  In  Europe,"  he 
said,  "  it  may  be  the  custom  for  the  Imperial 
kitchen-maids  to  wear  cotton  trousers,  but  in 
Morocco  we  have  more  appreciation  of  the  dignity 
of  their  position." 

There  was  nothing  more  to  be  said.  The  debt 
was  paid  by  the  Protectorate  Government. 

The  long  discussions  which  the  writer,  practically 
unaided,  had  to  maintain  with  the  Sultan  were 
not  always  facilitated  by  the  surroundings  in  which 
they  took  place.  There  were  no  regular  business 
hours  for  these  conversations  or  for  the  examina- 
tion of  the  voluminous  documents  which  they 

I 


130  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

often  necessitated,  and  which  were  always  in  the 
wildest  disorder,  but  which  none  the  less  required 
a  careful  perusal.  Whenever  and  wherever  His 
Majesty  felt  inclined  he  would  burst  out  with  his 
grievances,  and  as  at  all  costs  he  had  to  be  kept 
apart  from  the  French  authorities,  the  whole 
storm  used  often  to  fall  on  the  writer's  head.  At 
times  the  ex-Sultan,  struck  by  a  brilliant  idea 
how  to  escape  the  payment  of  some  small  sum, 
would  arrive  at  my  villa  at  dawn — at  others 
I  was  hastily  summoned  to  the  palace  at  mid- 
night. The  debts  were  discussed  and  argued  over 
in  every  possible  situation,  and  any  one  present, 
native  or  European,  high  authority  or  slave,  was 
dragged  into  the  discussion.  There  were  two  aged 
ladies  whose  opinion  was  constantly  asked.  One 
was  an  old  black  slave  nurse,  the  other  a 
Berber  woman,  quite  white,  who  was  the  Sultan's 
soothsayer  and  fortune-teller.  Her  advice  was 
always  good  and  to  the  point,  and  she  never 
hesitated  to  tell  the  ex-Sultan  that  he  was  acting 
foolishly  when  occasion  required,  and  she  rendered 
distinct  services  toward  the  unravelling  of  these 
complicated  questions. 

Sometimes  it  was  when  seated  on  mattresses 
and  rugs  in  a  garden,  surrounded  by  his  slaves, 
that  Mulai  Hafid  would  argue  that  all  debts  were 
State  debts,  and  that  private  property  never  had 
legally  existed,  and  that  individual  responsibility 
— especially  for  debts — was  contrary  to  the  highest 
principles  of  divine  nature.  He  discoursed  with 


MULAI    HAFID. 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  131 

great  facility  and  great  literary  ability.  He  had 
a  classical  Arabic  quotation  at  hand — often  most 
skilfully  misquoted — to  prove  his  every  argument. 
He  could  persuade  others  quickly,  and  himself  at 
once.  Leaning  slightly  forward,  swathed  in  his 
soft  white  robes,  he  would  speak  slowly  and  with 
great  distinctness  and  charm,  with  an  accompany- 
ing slow  movement  of  his  right  hand — and  then  in 
the  middle  of  it  all  his  attention  would  be  attracted 
by  his  elephants  or  his  llamas  or  a  group  of  cranes 
that  would  come  wandering  out  of  the  shrubberies, 
and  turn  his  thoughts  and  his  conversation  into 
new  channels. 

While  the  two  elephants  were  being  brought 
from  Fez  to  Tangier  at  the  time  of  the  abdication, 
one  of  them  escaped  on  the  road,  and  being  an 
unknown  beast  to  the  villagers  of  the  countryside, 
it  met  with  many  adventures.  Wherever  it  ap- 
peared arose  panic  and  consternation,  and  the  whole 
male  population  turned  out  with  such  weapons  as 
they  could  lay  their  hand  on  to  drive  away  this 
terrible  and  unknown  beast.  The  country  popula- 
tion, however,  possessed  little  but  very  primitive 
firearms,  whose  range  was  short,  and  whose  bullets 
dropped  harmlessly  off  the  sides  and  back  of  the 
huge  pachyderm,  thereby  increasing  the  panic. 
The  elephant,  luxuriating  in  the  spring  crops, 
grazed  undisturbed,  while  from  as  near  as  they 
dared  to  approach  the  outraged  proprietors  poured 
volleys  against  its  unheeding  bulk.  But  one  day 
it  found  itself  on  the  road  again,  and  came  rolling

along  into  Tangier  none  the  worse,  but  remark- 
ably spotted  all  over  with  the  marks  of  the  spent 
bullets. 

It  was  during  one  of  these  long  discussions  of 
claims  that  news  was  brought  to  the  Sultan  that 
one  of  these  elephants  was  lying  down  in  its  stable 
and  was  unable  to  rise.  This  information,  of  course, 
put  an  end  to  all  business,  and  we  set  out  at  once 
to  see  what  had  happened.  Sure  enough,  the 
female  elephant  was  lying  on  her  side,  every  now 
and  then  struggling  but  vainly  to  get  up. 

After  everybody  present  had  given  an  opinion, 
and  every  effort  had  been  made  to  put  the  poor 
creature  on  her  legs — from  twisting  her  tail  to 
lighting  a  lucifer  match  under  her  hind-legs, 
which  failed,  of  course,  even  to  singe  the  skin — 
Mulai  Hafid  arrived  at  the  conclusion  that  only 
by  the  aid  of  a  crane  could  the  elephant  be  raised. 

A  heavy  beam  was  found,  and  made  fast  to 
ropes  hung  from  the  roof.  Two  other  ropes  were 
passed  under  the  elephant's  recumbent  body,  one 
just  behind  her  front-legs,  the  other  just  in  front 
of  her  hind  ones,  a  manoeuvre  that  entailed 
considerable  labour. 

When  everything  was  ready  the  slaves  began 
to  haul.  With  cries  and  shouts  of  mutual  encour- 
agement they  managed  to  raise  the  elephant  till 
she  was  swinging  suspended  in  the  air,  and  then 
set  to  work  to  lower  her  gently  on  her  feet.  In 
this  they  would  no  doubt  have  been  successful 
had  not  the  forward  one  of  the  two  ropes  slipped 
back,  with  the  result  that  the  unfortunate  pachy- 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  133 

derm,  suspended  now  only  from  aft,  stood  on  her 
head,  and  remained  hung  up  in  this  posture 
until  she  was  lowered  to  earth  once  more,  this 
time  with  her  face  to  the  wall  in  a  more  impossible 
position  than  ever.  But  in  spite  of  all  the  diffi- 
culties, after  much  shouting,  swearing,  and  a  good 
deal  of  real  hard  work,  she  was  restored  to  a 
standing  posture. 

There  were  many  occasions  when  our  conversa- 
tions were  in  less  pleasant  places  than  the  gardens. 
There  was  a  room,  for  instance,  in  a  hideous 
villa  that  Mulai  Hafid  had  bought  as  it  stood, 
and  greatly  admired,  that  seemed  haunted  by  the 
microbe  of  irritability.  Not  only  was  its  decoration 
appalling,  but  it  was  full  of  a  host  of  objects  which 
the  ex-Sultan  had  brought  from  Fez,  amongst 
them  innumerable  musical-boxes,  clocks  of  every 
shape  and  form — he  evidently  particularly  fancied 
a  kind  made  in  the  shape  of  a  locomotive  engine 
in  coloured  metals,  the  wheels  of  which  all  turned 
round  at  the  hours,  half-hours,  and  quarters,  and 
mechanical  toys.  Everything,  or  nearly  every- 
thing, was  broken,  and  an  Italian  watchmaker 
was  employed  in  trying  to  sort  out  the  wheels, 
bells,  and  other  internal  arrangements  of  this 
damaged  collection  of  rubbish.  It  was  in  this 
room  that  he  had  set  up  his  workshop,  and 
nothing  pleased  Mulai  Hafid  more  than  to  sit  and 
watch  him. 

Now  it  was  not  unseldom  the  writer's  duty  to 
break  to  the  ex- Sultan  the  news  that  the  French 
authorities  refused  to  pay  such  and  such  a  debt. 


134  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

With  all  oriental  autocrats  it  is  best  to  break 
bad  news  gently,  for  they  are  usually  wanting 
in  self-restraint,  and  are  not  accustomed  to  blunt 
facts.  Often  it  required  considerable  time  and  a 
neatly-expressed  argument,  couched  in  Arabic  at 
once  diplomatic  and  literary,  to  carry  out  the 
task  successfully  and  escape  an  access  of  temper. 
I  would  begin  with  a  little  discourse  on  the 
origin  of  revenues,  the  ex-Sultan  would  listen 
attentively,  and  then  just  as  the  moment  arrived 
to  bring  generalities  into  line  with  actual  facts, 
the  Italian  watchmaker  would  meet  with  an  un- 
expected success.  Clocks  would  begin  to  strike 
and  chime,  or  a  musical-box,  old  and  wheezy,  to 
play,  or  an  almost  featherless  stuffed  canary  in  a 
cage  would  utter  piercing  notes  in  a  voice  that 
moth  and  rust  had  terribly  corrupted — or  from 
near  the  Italian's  chair  some  groaning  mechanical 
toy  would  crawl  its  unnatural  course  over  the 
carpet,  eventually  to  turn  over  on  its  back  and 
apparently  expire  in  a  whizz  of  unoiled  wheels. 
The  ex-Sultan's  attention  would  stray.  There  was 
an  end  of  business,  and  it  generally  led  to  the 
ordering  of  a  meal  to  be  served  to  every  one — at 
any  hour  and  on  any  excuse — at  which  the  watch- 
maker, who  might  have  only  just  finished  a  repast, 
was  the  guest  of  honour,  and  was  forced  to  eat 
incredible  quantities  of  very  rich,  but  very  excel- 
lent, food.  And  what  was  left  of  the  royal  repast 
was  handed  out  of  the  windows  and  served  to  the 
slaves  and  gardeners. 

Perhaps  the  most  difficult  claim  to  settle  was 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  135 

that  of  the  Sultan's  Spanish  (ientist,  for  not  only  ' 
was  it  extremely  complicated,  but  it  also  became 
almost  international.  It  might  naturally  be  sup- 
posed that  the  dentist's  bill  was  for  professional 
services;  but  no — it  was  for  a  live  lion.  In  the 
early  days  of  his  reign  the  Sultan  had  engaged  the 
dentist  at  a  regular  stipend,  and  he  had  become 
a  permanent  member  of  His  Majesty's  household. 
For  a  time  he  was  kept  busy  patching  up  the 
mouths  of  the  Court,  but  the  task  was  at  length 
accomplished,  and  the  ladies'  teeth  glistened  with 
gold.  The  dentist  remained  unemployed. 

Now  there  is  no  possible  reason  in  the  world 
why  dentists  shouldn't  be  employed  to  buy  lions.  ,• 
It  is  not,  of  course,  usual,  and  so  sounds  incon- 
gruous. In  Morocco,  views  as  to  the  limitations 
of  professions  are  much  less  restricted  than  with 
us.  In  Mulai  Abdul  Aziz's  time,  a  very  few  years 
ago,  one  of  the  duties  of  the  Scotch  Court-piper 
was  to  feed  the  kangaroos,  the  professional  photo- 
grapher made  scones,  a  high  military  authority 
supplied  the  Sultan's  ladies  with  under-linen,  and 
the  gardener  from  Kew  was  entrusted  with  the 
very  difficult  task  of  teaching  macaw  parrots  to 
swear.  And  so  it  was  not  surprising  that  the 
dentist  became  a  buyer  of  lions. 

In  the  first  flush  of  his  success  at  the  beginning 
of  his  reign,  Mulai  Hafid  was  setting  himself  up 
as  an  orthodox  Sovereign  by  Divine  Right,  and 
this  necessitated  a  menagerie.  It  is  one  of  the 
attributes  of  royalty  which  has  almost  dis- 
appeared, except  in  the  East,  though  at  one  time 


136  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

universal.  It  is  perhaps  fortunate.  The  hurried 
entrance  of  an  excited  rhinoceros  amongst  the  guests 
at  a  garden  party  at  Windsor  Castle  would  prove 
embarrassing,  and  so,  to  a  lesser  degree,  would  be 
the  presence  of  a  hyena  at  the  evening  service 
at  St  George's  Chapel ;  but  at  Morocco  similar 
incidents  would  have  attracted  little  or  no  atten- 
tion. The  father  of  Mulai  Hafid,  Mulai  Hassen, 
allowed  his  tame  leopards  to  roam  about  his 
reception-rooms ;  but  his  son,  more  timid  by  nature, 
confined  the  leopards  in  cages,  and  replaced  them 
in  his  drawing-room  by  guinea-pigs.  The  effect 
lost  in  majesty,  but  the  afternoon  callers  were  less 
nervous. 

So  the  dentist  was  sent  to  Hamburg  to  buy  wild 
beasts  from  Hagenbeck.  But  he  erred.  He  should 
have  returned  with  the  menagerie  and  shared  its 
glory.  He  delayed,  and  when  he  arrived  in  Fez  a 
few  months  later  the  novelty  and  glamour  of  the 
wild  beasts  was  passed,  and  the  reception  that  he 
and  the  belated  unpaid-for  lion — the  last  of  a 
series  of  lions — met  with  was  by  no  means  en- 
thusiastic. Mulai  Hafid  had  discovered  that  the 
upkeep  of  so  many  sheep-eating  beasts  was  ex- 
pensive, as  the  tribes,  on  the  eve  of  revolt,  refused 
to  supply  the  sheep,  and  insultingly  demanded 
payment. 

So  far  the  claim  presented  no  insurmountable 
difficulties,  but  there  were  complications ;  for  the 
Sultan,  immensely  attracted  by  the  mechanism  of 
the  dentist's  operating  -  chair,  had  some  time 
previously  ordered  from  the  dentist,  and  paid  for, 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  137 

a  throne  to  be  constructed  on  the  same  mechanical 
principles.  This  throne  had  never  been  supplied, 
so  there  was  a  counter-claim.  The  Sultan  stated 
that  he  had  paid  for  the  lion  ;  or  if  he  hadn't, 
then  it  was  a  State  debt,  for  which  he  was  not 
responsible,  and  demanded  the  delivery  of  his 
mechanical  throne.  The  question  was  still  under 
discussion  when  the  term  of  the  dentist's  contract 
expired,  and  the  ex-Sultan  notified  him  that  it 
would  not  be  renewed.  But  the  dentist  held  a 
trump  card,  for  the  ex-Sultan  had  lodged  him, 
rent  free,  in  a  little  villa  situated  on  one  of  His 
Majesty's  Tangier  properties.  The  dentist  refused 
to  quit,  and  the  Spanish  authorities  upheld  him, 
for  by  the  capitulations  each  Power  protects  the 
interests  of  its  respective  subjects.  A  body  of 
slaves  were  sent  to  eject  him.  They  found  the 
villa  barricaded,  and  were  met  with  pistol-shots. 
The  complications  were  becoming  serious,  and  in- 
ternational in  character.  The  Sultan,  the  French 
authorities,  the  Spanish  dentist,  the  black  slaves, 
the  writer,  a  British  subject,  and  the  German  lion 
threatened  to  cause  annoyance  to  the  Govern- 
ments of  Europe  if  recourse  was  made  to  firearms. 
I  made  an  impassioned  appeal  for  conciliation 
on  every  one's  part.  After  much  delay  and  no 
little  difficulty,  an  interview  was  arranged  between 
the  ex-Sultan  and  the  dentist,  at  which  as  medi- 
ator I  was  to  be  present.  Each  was  st  '  >usly 
coached  in  the  part  he  was  to  play :  the  dentist's 
pj-ainjive  appeals  to  the  generosity  of  the  ex- 
Sovereign  were  carefully  rehearsed,  as  were  also 


138  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

the  Sovereign's  "  gracious  reply,"  while  the  writer's 
little  speech  on  the  blessing  of  brotherly  love  was 
a  gem  of  the  first  quality. 

Mulai  Hafid  was  seated  on  a  divan  studiously 
reading  a  book  when  the  dentist  entered  and  made 
his  obeisance,  but  this  obeisance — polite  but  inten- 
tionally curtailed — did  not  meet  with  His  Majesty's 
approval.  Instead  of,  as  arranged,  smilingly 
acknowledging  the  dentist's  salutation,  the  ex- 
Sultan  continued  reading  half  aloud  in  a  sing- 
song drawl. 

A  long  period  ensued,  broken  by  one  of  the  suite, 
who  said,  "  My  lord  the  King,  the  dentist  is  here." 

Without  raising  his  eyes  from  his  book  the  ex- 
Sultan  asked  in  the  softest  of  voices — 

"  Has  he^brought  my  mechanical  throne  ?  " 

fNow  that  wasn't  on  the  programme  at  all ! 
There  was  to  have  been  no  mention  of  such  dis- 
tressing objects  as  dentist-chair-thrones  or  lions. 
There  was  to  have  been  purely  and  simply  a 
reconciliation :  a  sum  of  money  promised  to  the 
dentist  if  he  would  quit  the  villa,  and  a  general 
abandonment  of  claim  and  counter-claim.  But 
alas  !  before  any  one  could  intervene  the  dentist 
shouted  out — 

"  Pay  me  for  my  lion  !  " 

And  then  the  fat  was  in  the  fire.  For  some 
moments  the  atmosphere  boiled  with  vituperative 
allusions  to  lions  and  dentist-thrones,  until,  while 
the  writer  restrained  the  infuriated  potentate,  the 
dentist  was,  struggling  and  shouting,  removed 
from  the  presence-chamber. 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  139 

By  dint  of  great  persuasion  the  writer  eventually 
brought  about  a  settlement.  The  Sultan  did  not 
get  his  throne,  nor  did  he  pay  for  the  lion,  which 
the  Protectorate  Government  took  over,  not  having 
been  informed  that  it  had  meanwhile  died.  The 
dentist  received  a  sum  of  money  in  payment  of 
all  his  claims.  The  writer,  whose  solution  it  was, 
got  the  thanks  of  none  of  them,  all  three  parties 
concerned  expressing  themselves  as  distinctly  dis- 
satisfied with  the  settlement  arrived  at. 


VI. 

THE   SULTAN   AT   HOME. 

IN  1912-1913  the  modern  palace  which  the  latest 
of  the  abdicated  Sultans,  Mulai  Hafid,  has  built 
himself  at  Tangier,  and  which  covers  several  acres 
of  ground  with  its  immense  blocks  of  buildings 
and  its  courtyards,  was  still  rising  from  the  level 
of  the  soil,  and  His  Majesty  was  temporarily 
housed,  with  all  his  retinue,  in  the  old  Kasbah 
at  the  top  of  the  town.  It  is  a  spacious,  uncomfort- 
able, out-of-date,  and  out-of-repair  old  castle,  and 
it  formed  by  no  means  a  satisfactory  place  of 
residence,  for  it  was  not  easy  to  install  168  people 
within  its  crumbling  walls  with  any  comfort  or 
pleasure.  When,  too,  it  is  taken  into  account 
that  many  of  these  168  people  were  royal  ladies 
with  royal  prerogatives  as  to  their  apartments — 
to  say  nothing  of  their  pretensions  to  the  "  most 
favoured  ladies' ' '  treatment — it  can  be  realised 
that  the  solution  was  not  easy.  Even  in  the  most 
luxurious  of  quarters  the  ladies  of  the  palace  are 
said  to  give  considerable  trouble,  for  jealousy  is 
rife ;  and  if  one  of  them  receives  more  attentions 
— personal  or  in  presents — than  the  rest,  there  are 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  141 

often  disturbing  scenes — and  rumour  says  that 
the  "  Arifas  " — the  elderly  housekeepers  charged 
with  keeping  order — not  unseldom  make  use  of 
the  equivalent  of  the  "  birch  rod  " — a  knotted 
cord. 

The  royal  ladies  completely  filled  all  the  avail- 
able accommodation  in  the  Kasbah,  and  the  Sultan 
was  able  to  reserve  for  his  private  use  only  a  couple 
of  very  shabby  rooms  over  the  entrance.  Here 
he  would,  apologetically,  receive  his  guests  until 
the  purchase  of  the  large  garden  in  which  he  con- 
structed his  new  palace  furnished  him  with  more 
convenient  apartments ;  for  there  was  a  villa  in 
the  garden  which  had  been  erected  by  its  former 
owner,  a  wealthy  and  respected  Israelite,  who  had 
for  years  filled  the  post  of  Belgian  Vice-Consul. 
This  villa,  which  still  exists,  is  an  astounding 
example  of  extraordinary  taste — a  pseudo-moresque  \ 
copy  of  a  toy -house,  over  which  plaster  and  paint 
of  every  colour  had  been  poured  in  amazing  pro- 
fusion. Plaster  lions  guard  its  entrance,  more  like 
great  diseased  pug-dogs  than  the  king  of  beasts, 
and  to  add  to  their  attractions  they  were  then 
painted  all  over  with  red  spots.  A  scalloped  arch- 
way crowned  the  front  door,  and  the  former  owner 
had  once  pointed  out  to  the  writer  that  each  of 
the  thirty-two  scallops  was  painted  a  different 
colour,  which  was  quite  evident.  Inside,  decora- 
tion had  run  riot  in  the  wildest  way.  The  ceilings 
dripped  with  plaster  protuberances  in  reds  and 
gold.  Mouldings  pursued  their  strange  courses 
all  over  the  parti-coloured  walls,  enclosing  odd- 


142  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

shaped  panels  painted  with  views  of  lakes  and 
mountains  and  impossible  fishing-boats — designed 
and  executed  by  some  local  genius.  Chande- 
liers of  coloured  glass  hung  suspended  from  the 
ceilings,  and  the  windows  were  fitted  with  panes  of 
green  and  purple.  The  Sultan  was  in  ecstasies, 
and  furnished  these  astounding  apartments  with 
chairs  and  sofas  covered  in  red  plush  trimmed  with 
blue  and  yellow  fringes,  and  studded  with  blue 
and  yellow  buttons.  On  the  walls  he  hung  pro- 
miscuously a  score  of  clocks  of  all  sizes  and  shapes ; 
he  littered  tables  with  mechanical  toys ;  he  piled 
up  musical-boxes  in  every  corner ;  he  hung  cages 
of  canaries  in  every  window,  and  adorned  the 
chimneypiece  with  baskets  of  paper-flowers — and 
then  he  sat  down,  happy,  to  enjoy  civilisation. 

Amongst  many  mechanical  toys  which  Mulai 
Hafid  possessed  was  one  which  in  its  absurdity 
surpassed  any  toy  I  have  ever  seen.  It  was — or 
had  been — a  parrot,  life-sized,  seated  on  a  high 
brass  stand  which  contained  music.  Moth  and 
rust  had  corrupted,  and  there  was  little  left  of  the 
gorgeous  bird  except  a  wash-leather  body  the  shape 
of  an  inflated  sausage,  with  the  two  black  bead 
eyes  still  more  or  less  in  place,  and  a  crooked  and 
paralysed-looking  beak.  The  legs  had  given  way, 
and  the  cushion  of  a  body  had  sunk  depressedly 
on  to  the  brass  perch.  One  long  red  tail-feather 
shot  out  at  an  angle,  and  round  its  neck  and 
sparsely  distributed  over  its  body  were  the  remains 
of  other  plumes,  of  which  little  but  the  quills 
remained.  On  either  side  were  the  foundations 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  143 

of  what  had  once  been  its  wings,  consisting  of 
mechanical  appliances  in  wood  and  wire.  Any- 
thing more  pitiful  than  this  relic  of  parrotry  could 
not  be  imagined. 

Every  now  and  then,  apparently  for  no  reason, 
this  strange  toy  came  to  life.  The  sausage-like 
body  wriggled,  the  broken  beak  opened,  the  tail- 
feather  shot  out  at  a  new  angle,  and  the  framework 
of  the  wings  extended  itself  and  closed  again  with 
a  click ;  and  then  after  a  mighty  effort,  which  ^ ,0 
gave  one  the  impression  that  the  ghost  of  a  bird 
was  going  to  be  sea-sick,  the  whistling  pipes  con- 
cealed in  the  brass  stand  began  to  play.  The 
music  was  at  a  par  with  the  bird — notes  were 
missing,  and  the  whole  scale  had  sunk  or  risen 
into  tones  and  demi-tones  of  unimaginable  com- 
position. To  recognise  the  tune  was  an  impossi- 
bility, but  the  thrill  of  the  performance  was 
undeniable.  It  seemed  as  though  there  was  a 
race  between  the  bird  and  the  pipes  to  reach  the 
climax  first.  Both  grew  more  and  more  excited, 
until  suddenly  there  was  a  long  wheeze  and  longer 
chromatic  scale  from  high  to  low,  and,  with  an 
appealing  shake  of  its  palsied  head,  the  parrot 
collapsed  once  more  into  its  state  of  petrified 
despair. 

Mulai  Hand  was  completely  content.  He  realised 
that  at  last,  after  the  sombre  pomp  of  the  palace 
at  Fez,  he  had  settled  down  to  modern  life  and 
refinement,  and  had  attained  "  taste."  It  was  his 
custom  to  arrive  early  in  the  morning  and  spend 
his  days  there,  riding  down  from  the  Kasbah  on  a 


144  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

fat  saddle-mule  caparisoned  in  purple  or  pale  blue 
or  yellow,  accompanied  by  men  on  horseback, 
and  with  his  black  slaves  running  beside  him. 
Two  old  women — one  a  negress,  the  other  a  white 
Berber  woman — nearly  always  accompanied  him, 
poised  upon  fine  saddle-mules  and  closely  veiled. 
The  negress  was  his  old  nurse,  the  Berber  woman 
a  soothsayer  already  mentioned.  Arrived  in  the 
garden,  the  usual  series  of  mishaps  began.  One 
of  his  old  ladies  would  fall  off  her  frisky  mule, 
or  the  key  of  the  empty  house  was  lost,  and  an 
entry  had  to  be  made  by  forcing  a  window  after 
every  one  had  fussed  about  pretending  to  look  for 
the  key  for  half  an  hour  or  so.  Then  a  carpenter 
would  be  sent  for  to  mend  the  broken  window, 
and  a  slave  would  suddenly  remember  that  for 
fear  of  losing  the  key  he  had  tied  it  round  his  neck 
on  a  string,  where  it  still  hung  heavily  on  his 
chest.  Then  breakfast  would  arrive,  carried  down 
from  the  Kasbah  on  the  heads  of  black  slaves — 
great  trays  of  fresh  bread,  bowls  of  milk,  sodden 
half-warm  cakes  smothered  in  butter  and  honey, 
excellent  native  crumpets,  and  a  host  of  dishes  of 
fruits  and  pastry  and  sweets,  and  tea  and  coffee 
on  immense  silver  trays.  It  was  a  sort  of  pro- 
miscuous meal,  partaken  of  first  of  all  by  the 
Sultan  and  his  particular  friends,  then  passed  on 
to  the  "  courtiers,"  and  finally  handed  out  of  the 
windows  to  the  slaves,  gardeners,  and  retainers, 
who  completely  finished  what  was  left,  however 
great  the  quantity. 

By  this  time  the  workmen  had  begun  building 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  145 

operations  on  the  great  palace  a  hundred  yards 
or  so  away,  and  the  ex-Sultan  would  visit  the  site, 
taking  a  very  intelligent  interest  in  every  detail. 
Then  back  to  the  villa,  where  native  visitors  would 
be  received  and  literary  and  religious  questions 
discussed.  Mulai  Hafid  himself  is  no  mean  author, 
and  his  Arabic  verses  would,  if  published  at  that 
time,  have  gained  him  much  praise  and  many 
enemies.  To-day  there  is  no  reason  to  remain 
silent.  Circumstances  have  changed.  Was  it  not 
he  who  wrote  of  Tangier  ? — 

"  In  the  last  day  the  people  of  Tangier  came  to 
the  judgment  -  seat  of  God;  and  the  Supreme 
Judge  said,  '  Surely  you  are  the  least  and  worst 
of  all  people.  Under  what  circumstances  did  you 
live?' 

"  And  they  replied,  '  We  have  sinned ;  we  have 
sinned ;  but  our  Government  was  international : 
we  were  ruled  by  the  representatives  of  Europe.' 

"  And  the  Supreme  Judge  said,  '  Surely  you  have 
been  sufficiently  punished :  enter  into  Paradise.' ' 

By  any  one  who  knew  and  experienced  the 
international  Government  of  Tangier  these  verses 
cannot  fail  to  be  appreciated. 

Did  he  not  also  write  the  following  in  his  days 
of  contention  with  the  French  Government  ? — 

"  Is  not  the  wisdom  of  God  manifest  ? 
Has  He  not  given  intelligence  even  to  the  dog  ? 
A  little  less,  it  is  true,  than  to  the  elephant, 
But  a  little  more  than  He  bestowed  upon  the 
French  Administration." 

K 


146  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

When  Mulai  Hafid  purchased  the  property  of 
Ravensrock  at  Tangier,  which  had  for  many  years 
been  the  country  residence  of  the  late  Sir  John 
Drummond-Hay,  he  began  at  once  to  fell  the 
beautiful  trees  for  which  the  place  was  famous. 
Most  people  of  Arab  race  have  a  dislike  for  trees, 
which  is  no  doubt  one  of  the  reasons  why  Morocco 
is  so  treeless.  One  after  the  other  the  great  pines 
and  eucalyptus  disappeared ;  but  though  numbers 
of  men  were  employed,  the  work  did  not  progress 
fast  enough  to  satisfy  his  ex-Majesty. 

One  day  some  one  proposed  to  him  that  dyna- 
mite would  do  the  work  more  quickly,  so  he 
promptly  despatched  one  of  the  workmen  to  town 
to  buy  dynamite  cartridges  from  the  Spanish 
fishermen,  who  used  them  for  killing  fish  at  sea. 
I  was  with  the  ex-Sultan  when  the  messenger 
returned.  He  stood  before  us,  and,  turning  the 
hood  of  his  jelab  inside  out,  let  fall  on  the  ground 
at  our  feet  a  couple  of  dozen  of  these  highly- 
explosive  cartridges.  Fortunately  none  exploded. 
A  few  minutes  later  the  work  had  begun.  Holes 
were  quickly  drilled  in  the  trees  near  the  roots, 
and  the  cartridges  placed  in  position.  Fuses  were 
lit,  and  one  saw  scurrying  groups  of  men  bolting 
out  of  reach.  Then  there  was  a  crash,  and  some 
giant  of  the  mountain  came  crumbling  down  to 
earth,  to  the  intense  delight  of  Mulai  Hafid.  It 
was  reckless  destruction  of  what  had  taken  years 
of  care  and  attention  to  create,  but  nothing  would 
persuade  the  ex-Sultan  to  allow  these  beautiful 
woods  to  remain.  By  dint  of  very  special  pleading 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  147 

a  few  of  the  finest  trees  were  spared,  but  only 
a  few.  This  wholesale  destruction  was  carried 
out  principally  because  Mulai  Hafid  feared  assassin- 
ation, and  wished  to  eliminate  from  his  surround- 
ings any  covert  in  which  the  would-be  assassin 
could  conceal  himself. 

The  ex-Sultan  took  assiduously  to  bridge,  and 
played  whenever  he  got  the  chance.  One  of 
these  chances  was  with  his  dentist.  His  rela- 
tions with  his  own  particular  Spanish  dentist 
having  been  very  strained  on  the  question  of  the 
price  of  a  live  lion,  he  was  forced  to  apply  else- 
where for  such  dental  repairs  as  he  required  from 
time  to  time ;  and  fortune  favoured  him,  for  he 
discovered  an  excellent  American  dentist  who  had 
lately  arrived.  A  close  friendship  sprang  up 
between  the  ex-Sultan  and  the  dentist,  and,  as 
often  as  not,  bridge  took  the  place  of  dentistry. 
The  American  would  arrive  with  his  timid  lady- 
assistant  and  all  his  implements  of  torture,  only 
to  be  invited  to  sit  down  at  the  table  and  play 
cards.  The  lady-assistant  was  very  young  and 
very  shy,  and  was  more  accustomed  to  play 
children's  games  than  bridge.  A  fourth  player 
would  be  found,  and  the  ill-assorted  party  com- 
pleted. The  ex -Sultan  enjoyed  himself  im- 
mensely. He  generally  won,  perhaps  a  little  by 
never  permitting  the  trembling  lady-assistant  to  be 
his  partner.  In  this  manner  the  whole  afternoon 
would  be  passed,  and  Mulai  Hafid  in  the  evening 
would  show  the  few  francs  he  had  won  with  great 
joy.  The  points  were  one  franc  a  hundred,  so  no 


148  MOROCCO   THAT  WAS 

very  serious  damage  could  be  done ;  but  rich  as 
the  Sultan  was,  he  rejoiced  more  in  his  humble 
winnings  at  bridge  than  over  his  many  thousands 
in  the  banks.  Not  a  little  of  this  enjoyment  was 
owing  to  the  fact  that  he  felt  that  he  was  "  doing  " 
the  dentist.  "  He  comes,"  the  ex-Sultan  would 
say,  "  to  mend  my  teeth  and  to  take  my  gold, 
and  in  the  end  I  win  his  francs."  Weeks  went  by. 
Now  and  again  there  was  an  afternoon  for  real 
dentistry,  but  there  were  many  more  for  bridge, 
and  every  time  the  Sultan  won.  But  one  day  the 
climax  came.  The  teeth  were  excellently  repaired 
— the  work  was  of  the  best, — there  was  no  more 
to  be  done — but  to  pay  the  bill;  and  the  bill 
very  naturally  and  rightly  included  all  the  bridge 
hours — at  so  much  per  hour.  It  was  the  most 
expensive  bridge  Mulai  Hafid  ever  played. 

The  ex-Sultan's  bridge  was  peculiar.  It  would 
not  for  a  moment  be  hinted  that  the  irregularities 
that  occurred  in  the  game  were  due  to  anything 
but  accident,  but  these  little  accidents  were  very 
frequent.  The  ex-Sultan,  who  all  his  life  had 
been  accustomed  to  sit  cross-legged  on  a  divan, 
soon  tired  of  sitting  upright  on  a  chair.  He  would 
become  restless,  and  tuck  his  legs  underneath 
him.  Now  ordinary  chairs  are  not  intended  to 
be  sat  in  cross-legged,  especially  by  bulky  people ; 
and  as  generally  an  arm-chair  had  been  placed  for 
His  Majesty  to  sit  in,  he  would  constantly  be 
changing  his  position,  and  wriggling  to  make 
himself  more  comfortable  and  to  find  more  room 
for  his  capacious  legs.  These  wriggles  occasioned 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  149 

at  times  a  decided  movement  to  right  or  left, 
and  if  the  players  did  not  hold  their  cards  well 
up  it  was  their  own  fault.  Sometimes  he  would 
drop  his  cards,  and  his  long  sleeve  at  the  same 
time  would  sweep  the  tricks  already  won  on  to 
the  floor,  and  there  was  confusion  in  sorting  them. 
Once  or  twice  an  ace  unexpectedly  appeared  for 
the  second  time  in  the  game,  picked  up  by  accident 
from  the  floor,  no  doubt, — and  as  to  revokes — but 
with  a  plaintive  voice  he  would  say,  "  I  am  only 
a  beginner."  When  he  won  he  was  in  the  highest 
spirits ;  when  he  lost  he  sulked — but  he  didn't 
very  often  lose. 

It  is  a  characteristic  of  the  Moors  that  they 
hate  to  lose  a  game,  no  matter  what  they  are 
playing.  I  have  seen  the  most  exciting  games 
of  chess,  skilfully  and  quickly  played,  where  the 
loser  has  insisted  on  going  on  playing  game  after 
game  till  sometimes  in  pure  desperation  his 
adversary  allows  him  to  win.  Mulai  Abdul  Aziz, 
Mulai  Hafid's  predecessor  on  the  throne,  had  a 
unique  manner  of  scoring  at  cricket.  When  he 
was  Sultan  we  used  to  play  cricket  in  the  palace 
at  Fez,  generally  four  on  each  side.  The  score 
was  carefully  kept,  but  no  names  were  entered. 
When  the  game  was  finished  the  Sultan  himself 
placed  the  names  against  the  score,  always,  of 
course,  putting  his  own  in  front  of  the  largest. 
Then  the  name  of  the  player  he  liked  best  on  that 
particular  afternoon  had  the  second  best  score, 
and  so  on,  and  the  lowest  being  reserved  for  the 
person  most  out  of  favour.  The  score-book  was 


150  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

religiously  kept,  and  often  referred  to  by  the  Sultan, 
who  would  say,  "  That  was  a  great  afternoon. 
I  made  61  runs  and  Harris  made  48.  X.  played 
abominably,  and  only  made  2."  While  as  a  matter 
of  fact  His  Majesty  himself  had  made  2  and 
Harris  perhaps  none ;  while  the  unfortunate  man 
who  was  down  in  the  book  as  having  scored  2  was 
probably  the  excellent  batsman  who  had  made 
the  61  that  the  Sultan  claimed.  If  one  is  an 
autocratic  monarch  one  can  do  anything — even 
poach  your  neighbour's  cricketing  score.  I  remem- 
ber well  the  first  game  of  bridge  I  ever  played 
with  Mulai  Abdul  Aziz.  It  was  in  my  own  house 
after  a  dinner — the  first  European  dinner  the 
Sultan  ever  attended.  There  were  present  the 
British  and  French  Ministers,  and  the  staffs  of  the 
two  Legations.  It  was  all  rather  formal.  The 
Sultan  sat  at  the  head  of  the  table,  and  ate  very 
little ;  he  was  then  not  at  ease  with  knives  and 
forks.  After  dinner  we  sat  down  to  bridge.  The 
Sultan  and  Sir  Reginald  Lister,  who  then  repre- 
sented Great  Britain  in  Morocco,  played  against 
a  member  of  the  staff  of  the  French  Legation  and 
myself.  We  cut  for  deal,  and  I  drew  the  lowest 
card.  The  Sultan  was  seated  on  my  left.  I 
dealt,  and  declared  "  Hearts."  "  I  can't  play 
hearts,"  burst  out  His  Majesty  petulantly.  "  I 
haven't  got  any.  You  must  give  me  your  cards  "  ; 
and  I  was  obliged  to  pass  him  over  the  excellent 
"  Heart "  hand  on  which  I  had  declared  in  exchange 
for  his  barren  thirteen  cards,  containing  only  one 
small  trump.  But  "  Hearts  "  we  had  to  play,  and 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  151 

played,  and  my  partner  and  I  went  down  five 
tricks,  much  to  the  Sultan's  delight.  Luckily  we 
were  not  playing  for  money. 

That  was  not  the  only  amusing  episode  that 
happened  at  that  dinner.  There  had  been  a  long 
diplomatic  discussion  as  to  the  etiquette  to  be 
observed  with  the  ex-Sultan,  as  this  was  the  first 
European  dinner  he  had  ever  attended  and  would 
form  a  precedent.  It  was  decided  that  the  guests 
should  arrive  at  my  house  punctually  at  8,  and  the 
Sultan  at  8.15.  I  was  to  meet  the  Sultan  at  the 
door  and  conduct  him  into  the  drawing-room, 
where  I  was  to  present  to  him  the  Ministers  of 
Great  Britain  and  France,  who  in  turn  would 
present  their  suites.  This  was  all  very  well  on 
paper,  but  Mulai  Abdul  Aziz,  taking  an  intelligent 
interest  in  dinner  parties,  thought  he  would  like 
to  see  what  went  on  before  the  guests  came,  and 
instead  of  arriving  at  8.15  he  came  at  5  in  the 
afternoon.  He  apologised  for  being  a  little  before 
the  time,  and  expressed  his  desire  to  see  the  pre- 
parations. Two  minutes  later  he  was  in  the 
kitchen,  where  his  august  and  highly-saintly  pres- 
ence— for  he  was  a  direct  descendant  of  the 
Prophet,  and  to  his  countrymen  "  the  Com- 
mander of  the  Faithful" — somewhat  upset  the 
tranquillity  of  my  native  cooks  and  servants. 
But  ovens  had  to  be  opened  and  saucepans  un- 
covered, spoons  introduced  into  them,  and  the 
contents  exhibited ;  the  ice-machine  to  be  thor- 
oughly explained,  and  a  thousand  and  one  ques- 
tions answered.  Then  the  pantry  occupied  for

some  time  His  Majesty's  attention.  Nor  was  he 
less  interested  in  the  floral  decorations  of  the 
table  and  the  distribution  of  the  plate.  While  I 
dressed  for  dinner  he  sat  and  talked  to  my  native 
servants — the  Sultan  never  losing  his  dignity  nor 
my  men  their  respect — and  all  concerned  were 
completely  at  their  ease.  The  Moor  has  nearly 
always  the  perfect  manners  of  a  gentleman,  no 
matter  what  his  position,  and  the  sentiment  of 
the  country  is  essentially  democratic.  It  was  a 
common  incident  at  the  many  dinners  I  have 
since  given  for  the  two  ex-Sultans,  that  they  would 
appeal  to  the  men  who  served  the  table  for  con- 
firmation of  some  statement,  or  for  the  generally 
accepted  opinion  of  the  Moorish  people  on  some 
subject  under  discussion. 

At  8  o'clock  the  guests  arrived,  and  Mulai  Abdul 
Aziz,  being  already  in  the  house,  instead  of  arriving 
at  8.15  as  by  the  programme  he  should  have  done, 
had  to  be  concealed  in  a  room  upstairs.  Punctu- 
ally at  8.15  he  descended  the  stairs,  crossed  the 
hall,  and  entered  the  drawing-room.  He  was 
dressed  in  his  fine  long  white  flowing  garments, 
and  all  my  guests  expressed  to  me  afterwards 
their  appreciation  of  his  dignity  and  carriage  as 
he  made  his  formal  entry  and  during  the  pre- 
sentation of  the  guests.  Nor  were  they  less  struck 
by  the  undoubted  charm  of  his  manners,  the 
gentleness  of  his  voice,  and  his  intelligence,  which 
render  Mulai  Abdul  Aziz  perhaps  the  most  attrac- 
tive figure  in  Morocco  of  to-day. 

When  the  moment  arrived  for  the  ex-Sultan  to 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  153 

take  his  departure,  he  called  me  aside  and  said 
that  he  had  a  kitchen-range  in  his  palace,  but 
had  never  used  it.  He  was  pleased  to  say  that  the 
excellence  of  my  dinner  had  convinced  him  that 
his  own  range  must  be  set  to  work  at  once — and 
had  I  a  sack  of  coal,  as  he  had  none,  for  in  his 
kitchens  only  wood  and  charcoal  were  burned  ? 
In  a  few  minutes  my  servants,  in  their  smartest 
liveries,  were  filling  a  sack  with  coal  in  the  back 
premises.  When  it  was  ready  the  Sultan  left. 
The  guests  rose  to  their  feet,  the  Sultan  shook 
hands  with  them  all,  and  I  conducted  him  to  the 
door.  A  magnificently  caparisoned  riding -mule 
awaited  him,  and  mounted  slaves  were  at  the  gate. 
On  a  second  mule  was  an  officer  of  his  household, 
beautifully  dressed  in  white  clothes,  struggling  to 
balance  across  the  front  of  his  crimson  saddle  the 
almost  bursting  sack  of  coal. 

It  was  always  my  great  desire  to  bring  about 
a  reconciliation  between  the  two  ex-Sultans,  Mulai 
Abdul  Aziz  and  Mulai  Hafid,  but  I  never  suc- 
ceeded. Mulai  Hafid  had  driven  his  brother, 
Mulai  Abdul  Aziz,  from  the  throne,  and  naturally 
his  brother  had  no  reason  to  be  grateful  to  him. 
At  the  same  time,  Mulai  Hafid  always  blamed 
Mulai  Abdul  Aziz  for  having  ruined  Morocco,  and 
of  having  sown  the  seed  of  the  loss  of  Moroccan 
independence.  There  was  also  the  question  of 
precedence.  Mulai  Abdul  Aziz  had  been  Sultan 
first,  and  claimed  the  first  place.  Mulai  Hafid 
equally  claimed  it,  because  he  had  been  Sultan 
last.  After  many  unsuccessful  endeavours,  I  per- 


154  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

suaded  both  to  agree  that  if  they  met  by  chance 
on  the  road  they  would  salute  each  other  and 
embrace.  For  months  they  did  not  meet,  but  one 
day,  turning  a  sudden  corner,  their  riding-mules 
collided.  So  taken  aback  were  their  two  Majesties 
that  they  entirely  forgot  their  agreement,  and 
rode  away  in  opposite  directions  as  fast  as  their 
mules  could  carry  them. 

Immediately  after  the  reconciliation — if  such  it 
could  be  called — between  Mulai  Hafid  and  the 
French  authorities,  the  ex-Sultan  gave  a  dinner- 
party to  the  members  of  the  French  Legation  and 
a  number  of  other  French  officials,  in  a  charming 
villa  he  had  meanwhile  taken  on  the  Marshan,  at 
Tangier.  Not  sure  of  whom  he  ought  to  invite 
to  this  solemn  repast,  Mulai  Hafid  had  left  the 
choice  of  his  guests  to  the  French  Charge^  d' Affaires, 
who  had  sent  in  a  list.  The  hour  of  dinner  arrived, 
and  so  did  the  guests,  amongst  whom  was  the  very 
capable  and  excellent  "  Commissaire "  of  the 
French  local  police,  whom  His  Majesty  had  not 
yet  met.  The  presentations  took  place,  and  the 
Sultan  called  me  aside — I  was  in  attendance — and 
asked  who  certain  of  the  guests,  whom  he  didn't 
know  by  sight,  were.  When  I  informed  him  that 
one  of  them  was  the  French  Commissaire  de  Police, 
he  became  a  little  uneasy,  and  a  shadow  passed 
over  his  face.  "  What  do  you  think  he  has  come 
f or  ?  "  asked  the  ex-Sultan  nervously. 

Seeing  an  opportunity  for  a  joke  at  His  Majesty's 
expense,  I  hesitated  a  moment,  and  then,  with 
many  apologies,  informed  the  Sultan  that  there 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  155 

had  been  stories  current  about  his  manner  of 
playing  bridge.  No  one,  I  said,  believed  them, 
but  naturally  the  French  authorities  were  most 
desirous  that  there  should  be  an  end  to  this  false 
rumour,  and  had  therefore  decided,  very  privately 
of  course,  to  bring  the  "  Commissaire  de  Police  " 
to  watch  his  play  on  that  particular  evening.  As 
soon  as  they  were  assured  that  His  Majesty's 
play  was  above  all  suspicion,  an  official  dementi 
could  be  given  to  these  disturbing  rumours. 
Mulai  Hafid's  face  wore  a  look  of  unusual  gravity 
during  the  long  and  sumptuous  dinner. 

After  the  guests  had  adjourned  to  the  drawing- 
room  we  sat  down  to  bridge.  The  "  Commissaire," 
who  was  not  a  player,  was  purposely  invited, 
without  the  Sultan's  knowledge,  to  seat  himself 
at  Mulai  Hafid's  side.  The  game  began.  His 
Majesty  was  terribly  nervous.  Every  time  he 
wriggled  in  his  chair  and  leant  either  to  right 
or  left,  he  would  pull  himself  together  and  fix  his 
eyes  upon  his  own  cards.  Not  once  did  he  let  his 
"  hand  "  fall  on  the  floor.  Not  once  did  his  long 
sleeves  sweep  the  tricks  off  the  table.  Not  once 
did  he  revoke.  He  lost  game  after  game,  and  his 
distress  became  painfully  manifest. 

Between  two  "  deals  "  a  guest  approached  and 
politely  asked,  "  Is  Your  Majesty  winning  ?  " 

1  Winning  !  "  cried  the  now  thoroughly  upset 
monarch,  "  winning  !  How  can  I  possibly  win 
with  this  horror  of  a  policeman  watching  every 
card  I  play  ?  "  And  the  writer  had  to  explain  to 
the  assembled  company  the  whole  plot. 


156  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

Mulai  Hafid  was  an  excellent  host,  and  was  never 
happier  than  when  entertaining.  His  dinners 
were  well  served  and  always  amusing,  and  his 
guests,  European  and  native,  suitably  chosen. 
On  one  occasion  some  charming  and  aristocratic 
French  ladies  were  visiting  Morocco.  Amongst 
a  series  of  fetes  given  by  the  Diplomatic  Corps 
and  others  for  their  entertainment  was  a  banquet 
at  the  residence  of  the  Moorish  ex-Minister  of  War, 
Sid  Mehdi  el-Menebhi,  G.C.M.G.  At  this  ban- 
quet the  ex-Sultan  presided.  The  distinguished 
lady  guests  had  been  purchasing  Moorish  cos- 
tumes, and  it  was  arranged  that  they  should  come 
to  this  feast  arrayed  in  all  their  recently-acquired 
magnificence.  The  result  was  charming — so  charm- 
ing that  it  was  decided  to  send  for  a  photo- 
grapher and  have  the  group  taken.  On  his  arrival 
the  guests  were  posed,  Mulai  Hafid  seated  on  a 
cushioned  divan  surrounded  by  the  ladies  in  their 
Moorish  dresses.  The  men  stood  behind. 

The  photograph  was  a  great  success,  but  its 
indirect  results  almost  a  tragedy,  for  Mulai  Hafid 
placed  a  large  copy  of  the  group  on  the  mantel- 
piece of  the  drawing-room  of  his  villa.  The 
ladies  of  his  household  never  left  the  Kasbah, 
but  on  one  occasion  he  sent  an  old  Berber  lady, 
before  mentioned,  and  an  aged  slave,  who  had 
been  his  nurse,  to  visit  the  villa,  and  the  eagle 
eyes  of  this  venerable  dame  discovered  the  photo- 
graph. In  their  minds  no  clearer  evidence  of  Mulai 
Hafid' s  wickedness  could  be  imagined,  for  here 
was  the  ex-Sultan  seated  in  a  bevy  of  apparently 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  157 

s 

very  attractive  native  ladies,  surrounded  by  Euro- 
pean men.  No  combination  of  facts  could  to 
their  eyes  be  more  shocking.  Not  only  was  it 
clear  that  Mulai  Hafid  had  been  enjoying  the 
society  of  ladies  other  than  his  wives,  but  he  had 
even  not  hesitated  to  do  so  in  the  presence  of 
"  Christian  "  men.  So  the  photograph  was  con- 
veyed in  their  voluminous  raiment  to  the  Kasbah, 
where  it  was  presented  to  the  gaze  of  the  Sultan's 
outraged  wives.  Mulai  Hafid  was  out  hunting 
that  day,  and  it  was  he  himself  who  recounted  to 
the  writer  what  occurred  on  his  return.  None  of 
his  ladies  were  in  the  courtyard  to  meet  him ;  no 
one,  except  a  slave  or  two,  was  visible.  Not  a 
word  of  welcome,  not  a  question  as  to  the  sport 
he  had  enjoyed  !  Seeking  the  apartments  of  one 
of  the  royal  wives,  the  Sultan  had  the  mortification 
to  see  her  go  out  of  one  door  as  he  entered  by  the 
other.  He  called  to  her,  but  she  paid  no  attention. 
He  sought  consolation  elsewhere,  with  no  better 
results.  He  was  shunned  and  in  exile — not  one 
of  the  ladies  would  speak  to  him.  He  knew,  of 
course,  nothing  of  the  reason,  and  could  obtain 
no  explanation.  He  slept  in  his  little  reception- 
room  over  the  entrance  of  the  Kasbah,  and  hoped 
for  a  brighter  situation  in  the  morning,  but  things 
were  no  better. 

Then  the  two  old  women  who  had  found  the 
photograph  and  given  it  to  the  Sultan's  ladies 
grew  alarmed,  and  confessed,  but  the  many  wives 
were  difficult  to  convince,  and  it  was  only  when 
the  writer  was  called  in  and  explained  to  some 


158  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

invisible  persons,  concealed  behind  a  thick  curtain 
drawn  across  an  archway,  that  peace  and  calm 
were  restored  in  the  Shereefian  harem.  As  the 
Sultan  said  afterwards,  "  There  are  some  institu- 
tions in  Europe  which  are  in  a  way  preferable  to 
ours.  Monogamy  has  its  advantage.  When  a 
man  ever  quarrels  he  has  only  one  wife  to  quarrel 

with,  whereas  we ! '' 

The  ex-Sultan  had  a  very  numerous  family  of 
young  children,  to  whom  he  was  really  devoted, 
and  with  some  of  whom  he  would  play  for  long 
hours  together.  They  were — and  are  to-day — 
exceedingly  well  brought  up,  nice-mannered,  and 
beautifully  dressed,  and  now  that  they  are  a 
little  older  are  being  well  educated.  I  sometimes 
was  taken  to  see  them  in  a  garden  in  the  Kasbah. 
There  would  be  a  few  black  slave  women,  and  from 
ten  to  twenty  children,  all  probably  under  seven 
years  of  age,  and  varying  in  colour  from  very  dark 
to  very  fair.  Once  I  mentioned  to  Mulai  Hafid 
that  they  seemed  to  be  many.  He  laughed,  and 
replied  that  they  were  not  all  there :  none  of  the 
younger  ones  were  present,  and  that  in  all  there 
were  twenty-six  under  six  or  seven  years  of  age. 
He  was  certainly  a  devoted  father  to  his  numerous 
offspring.  During  the  whole  period  of  the  War 
he  has  been  separated  from  them.  In  1914  he  went 
to  Spain,  where  his  relations  with  the  German 
Embassy  caused  him  to  be  suspected  of  instigating 
intrigues  in  Morocco.  His  pension  was  cancelled, 
and  he  remains  to-day  an  exile.  Any  one  who  has 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  159 

known  him  in  his  family  life  and  witnessed  his 
devotion  to  his  children  cannot  help  desiring,  if 
his  actions  in  Spain  have  not  been  more  than 
follies,  that  he  may  be  permitted  once  more  to 
return  to  his  home. 


VII. 

THE   SULTAN  IN   FRANCE. 

IT  was  on  the  quay  at  Rabat,  that  picturesque 
old  town  on  the  Atlantic  coast  of  Morocco,  that 
the  Sultan  Mulai  Hafid  finally  handed  to  General 
Lyautey,  the  French  Resident-General  in  Morocco, 
the  documents  of  his  abdication.  It  had  been  a 
long  struggle  to  get  them ;  for  although  His 
Majesty  was  decided  that  the  only  course  open  to 
him  was  to  cede  the  throne  and  leave  the  country, 
still  he  was  desirous,  and  made  no  concealment 
of  his  desire,  to  bargain  to  the  very  last  moment. 
However,  at  length  the  question  was  settled,  and 
as  the  Sultan  stepped  on  board  the  launch  to 
proceed  to  the  French  cruiser  that  was  to  take 
him  as  far  as  Gibraltar,  en  route  to  France,  the 
official  document  of  abdication  was  handed  over. 
In  return  he  received  a  cheque  of  £40,000,  the  last 
instalment  of  the  agreed  sum  of  money  which  the 
new  Protectorate  Government  of  Morocco  had 
undertaken  to  pay  him. 

The  following  morning  the  cruiser,  with  the 
ex-Sultan  on  board,  arrived  at  Gibraltar.  I 
happened  to  be  there,  returning  from  Morocco 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  161 

to  England,  and  was  leaving  the  same  day  for 
Plymouth  by  steamer  direct.  Desirous,  however, 
of  seeing  some  personal  friends  who  were  amongst 
the  ex-Sultan's  suite,  I  proceeded  on  board  the 
French  cruiser  to  visit  them.  It  was  my  desire, 
if  possible,  to  avoid  meeting  the  ex-Sultan,  for  a 
few  months  previously  there  had  been  a  scene  in 
Fez,  in  which  the  unchecked  torrents  of  Sultanate 
wrath  had  been  poured  on  my  head  for  having 
given  too  much  publicity  to  the  barbarous  atro- 
cities which  His  Majesty  had  been  committing, 
especially  in  the  case  of  the  torturing  of  the  wife 
of  the  Governor  of  Fez,  in  order  to  discover  an 
imaginary  hidden  fortune,  and  in  the  wholesale 
amputations  of  the  feet  and  hands  of  certain 
rebel  tribesmen.  I  had  no  desire  that  the  dis- 
cussion as  to  the  necessity  or  advisability  of 
perpetrating  horrors  should  be  continued  on 
the  deck  of  a  French  warship,  and  so  I  took 
every  precaution  not  to  be  seen  by  His  Majesty 
in  order  to  avoid  the  outpourings  of  renewed 
wrath.  But  in  vain.  The  ex-Sultan  caught  a 
glimpse  of  me  as  he  stepped  on  board,  and, 
hurrying  to  meet  me,  embraced  me  in  the  most 
cordial  manner,  and  then  stated  that  unless  I 
would  consent  to  join  the  suite  and  continue  the 
journey  with  him  to  France,  he  (the  ex-Sultan) 
would  claim  the  right  of  being  in  British  territorial 
waters,  and  refuse  to  proceed  an  inch  farther. 
The  situation  was  difficult.  The  Sultan,  always 
neurasthenic,  appeared,  and  undoubtedly  was  suf- 
fering under  great  nervous  tension,  evidently  not 

L 


162  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

diminished  by  the  sufferings  he  had  undergone 
during  a  particularly  rough  passage  on  a  warship 
that  was  renowned  for  its  rolling. 

A  hurried  consultation  was  held  with  the  French 
officials  who  were  accompanying  the  ex-Sultan  on 
his  journey  to  France.  My  plans  were  already 
fixed  :  it  was  no  easy  matter  to  change  them 
at  the  last  moment;  but  the  Sultan  insisted. 
The  French  authorities,  too,  foreseeing  real  diffi- 
culties, begged  me  to  alter  these  plans  and  to 
proceed  to  France,  to  which  I  eventually  con- 
sented. The  Sultan,  appeased,  offered  no  more 
resistance  to  continuing  his  journey,  and  by  midday 
we  were  en  route  for  Marseilles. 

What  had  influenced  the  Sultan  was  this.  He 
was  suffering  from  nerves,  and  once  on  board  the 
warship  had  become  convinced  that  he  was  under 
arrest,  and  was  on  his  way  to  imprisonment  in 
France.  He  was  particularly  desirous  of  having, 
therefore,  as  members  of  his  suite  one  or  two 
persons  of  British  origin,  so  that  there  might  be 
witnesses— or  even  objectors — in  the  case  of  his 
incarceration.  Of  course  such  a  thought  had  never 
entered  the  minds  of  the  French  Government. 
The  Sultan  had  abdicated,  and  for  political  reasons 
it  was  advisable  that  he  should  absent  himself 
from  Morocco  for  a  short  period,  so  that  the 
proclamation  and  installation  of  the  new  Sovereign 
might  proceed  without  any  hitch ;  for  it  was 
always  possible  that  so  long  as  the  ex-Sultan 
remained  in  the  country  there  might  be  some 
opposition  to  the  elevation  of  his  successor  to 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  163 

the  throne.  Two  days  later  Mulai  Hafid  landed 
in  Marseilles,  where  he  was  officially  received. 
The  quay  was  hung  with  flags,  there  was  a  cavalry 
escort,  and  military  music  enlivened  the  scene. 

At  Gibraltar  the  French  cruiser  had  been 
abandoned  for  the  greater  comforts  and  more 
ample  space  of  a  P.  &  0.  On  board  this  steamer, 
en  route  to  Australia,  was  a  music-hall  troupe, 
and  it  was  their  kind  thought  to  give  a  perform- 
ance in  honour  of  the  Sultan.  The  sea  was  calm, 
the  night  warm,  and  after  dinner  the  performance 
took  place — singing,  dancing,  and  some  juggling. 
One  item  of  the  show  took  place  in  the  saloon, 
where  a  very  attractive  and  skilful  lady-conjurer 
performed  some  most  astonishing  tricks.  The 
Sultan  and  his  suite  were  much  impressed,  but 
their  astonishment  reached  its  climax  when  the 
charming  young  lady  filled  an  apparently  un- 
limited number  of  glasses  with  an  apparently 
unlimited  variety  of  drinks  out  of  a  medium-sized 
teapot. 

As  we  threaded  our  way  out  of  the  saloon,  one 
of  the  more  influential  of  the  native  suite  whis- 
pered in  my  ear,  "  What  do  you  think  the  lady 
would  take  for  the  teapot  ?  "  I  naturally  replied 
that  probably  all  the  wealth  of  the  world  could 
not  purchase  so  unique  a  vessel.  My  friend  was 
disappointed  ;  he  would  clearly  have  liked  to  own 
a  teapot,  and  to  have  had  it  always  beside  him, 
which  would  pour  out  any  beverage  he  com- 
manded. "  It  would  have  been,"  he  added  with 
a  sigh,  "  so  useful  when  one  was  travelling." 


164  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

His  Majesty's  stay  at  Marseilles  was  uneventful. 
Official  visits,  a  gala  at  the  theatre,  and  excursions 
to  places  of  interest  filled  up  his  days.  However, 
during  the  dinner — a  semi-state  ceremony — which 
was  given  to  His  Majesty  at  the  hotel  on  the 
evening  of  his  arrival,  a  little  incident  occurred. 
The  manager  of  the  hotel,  looking  very  troubled, 
approached  the  high  official  of  the  police  to  whom 
the  precautions  for  the  personal  security  of  the 
Sultan  had  been  entrusted,  and  whispered  in  his 
ear.  A  few  moments  later  I  received  a  message 
asking  me  to  leave  the  table  for  a  moment's  con- 
versation in  the  next  room.  Here  I  was  informed 
that,  while  dinner  was  proceeding,  the  Sultan's 
little  black  slave  boys  had  found  a  big  bag  of 
five-franc  pieces  in  His  Majesty's  bedroom,  and 
were  amusing  themselves  by  throwing  them  one 
by  one  into  the  street,  to  be  scrambled  for  by  the 
N.crowd.  The  Cannebiere  was  blocked,  all  traffic 
was  at  a  standstill,  and  various  wounded  persons 
had  already  been  taken  to  the  hospital ;  but  the 
black  imps,  delighted  with  their  game,  persistently 
refused  to  abandon  so  amusing  an  occupation 
unless  they  received  the  express  orders  of  their 
lord  and  master  to  do  so.  These  orders  the  writer 
hastily  invented,  and,  personally  visiting  the  scene, 
threatened  such  chastisement  that  the  three  or 
four  little  black  demons  slunk  away  to  bed. 

During  this  dinner  the  news  had  been  published 
in  the  local  evening  papers  of  a  serious  battle  in 
Morocco ;  for,  although  the  French  Protectorate 
had  been  proclaimed,  yet  there  was  still  anarchy 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  165 

existing  in  the  remoter  parts  of  the  country. 
Now  the  ex-Sultan  had  never  been  popular  in 
France,  perhaps  with  some  reason.  He  had 
driven  from  the  throne  his  brother,  whose  more 
friendly  feelings  toward  the  French  were  known 
and  appreciated,  and  he  had  succeeded  in  so  doing 
by  a  frankly  unfriendly  programme  toward  French 
policy.  His  tribes,  and  even  his  troops,  had  fought 
them  in  the  Chaouia  Campaign  of  1907-8,  and 
during  the  four  years  that  he  had  held  the  throne 
(1908-12)  he  had  done  his  utmost  to  assist  German 
intervention  in  Morocco.  It  was  therefore  not  to 
be  wondered  at  that  the  people  of  Marseilles 
showed  no  enthusiasm  for  their  guest,  and  com- 
plained of  the  honours  that  were  being  rendered 
him  and  the  cost  the  French  Government  was 
incurring  in  his  entertainment.  Up  till  now,  how- 
ever, there  had  always  been  a  show  of  interest 
in  his  movements,  and  a  little  crowd  to  see  him 
wherever  he  went ;  and  though  his  reception  had 
been  by  no  means  enthusiastic,  no  hostile  demon- 
stration had  taken  place.  The  receipt  of  the  news, 
however,  of  heavy  French  losses  in  this  latest 
Moorish  battle,  had  stirred  up  some  feeling  against 
him.  The  people  felt  it  was  ridiculous  that  while 
their  troops  were  being  shot  in  Morocco  the  origi- 
nator of  the  attacks  of  the  tribes  should  be  their 
honoured  guest  in  France.  And  so  it  was  that 
when,  after  the  dinner,  the  ex-Sultan  entered  the 
box  that  had  been  reserved  and  decorated  for  him 
in  one  of  the  great  music-halls  of  Marseilles,  he  was 
met  with  hoots  and  whistling. 


166  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

For  a  moment  no  one  could  explain  this  hostile 
demonstration,  for  the  news  of  the  battle  had  only 
just  been  published,  and  had  not  reached  the 
dinner  at  which  we  had  all  been  present.  The 
manner  in  which  the  demonstration  was  suppressed, 
and  a  few  moments  later  changed  into  a  most 
friendly  reception,  was  admirable,  and  spoke  well 
for  the  capabilities  of  the  "  Commissaire  de 
Police "  attached  to  the  ex-Sultan's  suite.  It 
was  manoeuvred  in  a  way  that  was  almost  un- 
noticeable.  A  number  of  people  seemed  to  be 
leaving  the  theatre,  but  discreetly,  as  if  in  the 
ordinary  course  of  their  affairs,  and  meanwhile 
their  places  and  every  vacant  seat,  and  even  the 
passage,  were  being  filled  up.  In  five  minutes  the 
building  was  full,  and  then  suddenly  the  band  burst 
out  with  the  "  Marseillaise"  ;  the  Sultan  stood  up, 
and  the  whole  audience,  turning  toward  the  royal 
box,  shouted  and  cheered.  It  was  well  done,  and 
had  all  the  appearance  of  being  a  spontaneous 
demonstration. 

Although  Mulai  Hafid  was  by  no  means  popular 
in  France,  his  visit  received  a  good  deal  of  atten- 
tion, and  the  French  public  took  considerable 
interest  in  his  personality.  He  was,  in  fact,  the 
man  of  the  hour.  His  portrait  appeared  in  every 
paper,  and  all  his  movements  were  closely  reported 
and  read. 

His  Majesty,  who  never  minded  how  dangerously 
fast  he  travelled  in  motor-cars,  had  a  horror  of 
the  train,  and  it  had  been  a  little  difficult  to 
persuade  him  to  consent  to  proceed  to  Vichy  by 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  167 

that  means.  The  distance  being  great,  the  journey 
by  motor,  with  his  numerous  suite  of  French 
officers  and  diplomats  and  all  his  native  retinue, 
would  have  been  a  difficult  one  to  have  organised. 
So  three  days  after  his  arrival  at  Marseilles  he 
entered  the  carriages  that  had  been  specially 
added  to  the  train  that  was  to  convey  him 
to  the  fashionable  health  resort.  He  was  un- 
mistakably nervous  as  we  left,  and  made  no 
secret  of  it.  As  the  pace  increased  he  wanted 
the  train  stopped,  and  said  he  would  walk  to 
Vichy  rather  than  continue ;  but  the  climax  was 
reached  when,  with  a  shrill  whistle,  the  train 
hurled  itself  into  a  long  tunnel,  and  apparently 
into  unending  darkness. 

The  Sultan's  fear  was  pitiful  to  behold.  He 
literally  clung  to  the  French  officer  beside  him, 
with  terror  staring  from  his  eyes.  All  he  could 
utter  was,  "  Tell  them  to  stop ;  why  don't  you 
tell  them  to  stop  !  "  The  fright  of  his  native 
retainers  was  even  more  marked.  They  called  out 
and  clung  to  each  other  in  abject  fear,  except  the 
little  black  slave  boys,  who  seemed  intensely 
amused.  Then  the  train  whirled  out  of  the  tunnel 
into  daylight  again.  The  Sultan  pulled  himself 
together,  and  said,  with  an  air  of  offended  majesty, 
"  You  will  kindly  tell  them  not  to  do  it  again." 

"  I  am  afraid  it  will  be  difficult  to  avoid." 

"  Why  ?  " 

"  Because  the  line  must  pass  under  the  hills." 

"  Then  the  train  must  stop  and  I  will  walk  over 
the  top  and  join  it  again  on  the  other  side." 


168  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

"  The  distance  .  .  ." 

"I  do  not  mind  the  distance.  Anything  is 
better  than  such  suffering  as  it  occasions  me." 

However,  he  was  persuaded  that  his  proposal 
was  impracticable,  and  bore  the  few  more  tunnels 
that  we  passed  through  with  commendable  sang- 
froid and  courage,  though  on  each  occasion  His 
Majesty  expressed  his  very  distinct  disapproval  of 
railways  and  their  builders,  and  more  especially 
the  folly  of  making  tunnels. 

At  Vichy  a  villa,  which  formed  an  annexe  to 
the  well-known  Hotel  Majestic,  was  placed  at  his 
disposal.  His  Majesty  was  an  early  riser,  and 
sometimes  he  would  take  an  early  morning  prome- 
nade in  the  gardens  and  streets  of  the  town.  On 
one  of  these  occasions  he  bought  a  little  mongrel 
puppy,  which  an  itinerant  dog-seller  was  hawking 
at  the  end  of  a  string.  Returning  to  his  villa  with 
his  purchase,  the  antics  of  the  little  puppy  so 
amused  the  ex-Sultan  that  he  called  in  his  slaves, 
and  ordered  them  to  disperse  over  the  town  and 
buy  more  dogs.  One  of  the  dusky  servitors  ventured 
to  ask  how  he  was  to  know  which  dogs  were  for 
sale.  The  Sultan,  fresh  from  his  experience  of 
purchasing  the  puppy,  replied  that  every  dog  at 
the  end  of  a  string  was  for  sale.  As,  of  course, 
none  of  the  slaves  spoke  anything  but  Arabic, 
they  were  ordered  to  bring  dogs  and  sellers 
alike  to  the  villa,  where  the  bargains  would  be 
completed. 

Now  the  municipal  authorities  of  Vichy  had 
recently  issued  an  order  that  all  dogs  were  either 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  169 

to  be  led  or  muzzled,  so  when  the  fashionable 
world  went  out  to  drink  its  early  morning  waters, 
at  least  half  of  the  ladies  had  little  dogs  at  the 
end  of  a  string. 

The  writer  was  at  breakfast  when  he  was  hur- 
riedly summoned  to  the  villa.  At  an  open  window 
on  the  ground  floor,  sitting  cross-legged  on  an 
arm-chair,  was  His  Majesty  looking  down  with  a 
puzzled  expression  upon  the  little  garden,  crowded 
with  excited  ladies  and  little  dogs.  Some  were  in 
tears,  others  wore  expressions  of  interested  curi- 
osity, and  a  few  were  evidently  trying  to  look 
their  best,  for  no  social  distinctions  had  been 
recognised  by  the  slaves  who  had  "  rounded  them 
up  "  in  the  promenades  of  Vichy. 

"  I  want  to  buy,"  said  the  ex-Sultan  from  his 
window,  "  all  these  little  dogs,  but  the  sellers  do 
not  seem  to  understand  the  first  principles  of 
trade,  and  seem  to  be  making  a  terrible  fuss." 

The  situation  was  evident  and  acute.  I  ex- 
plained it  to  the  ex-Sultan,  who  politely  apolo- 
gised for  having  disturbed  the  ladies'  early  walks, 
but  still  insisted,  without  success,  in  trying  to 
buy  the  dogs.  It  required  all  the  writer's  tact 
and  diplomacy  to  put  an  end  to  a  difficult  situa- 
tion, and  to  restore  equanimity  to  the  indignant 
ladies. 

The  ex-Sultan's  purchases  were  often  embarrass- 
ing. One  evening  at  sunset  he  visited  a  farm  a 
few  miles  from  the  town,  and  insisted  upon  going 
all  over  it.  In  an  enclosure  were  collected  from 
twenty  to  thirty  fine  specimens  of  the  beautiful 


170  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

white  cattle  for  which  this  part  of  France  is  so 
justly  famous.  The  ex-Sultan  decided  to  buy  the 
lot,  and  gave  the  farmer  his  card,  saying,  "  Send 
them  round  to-night  to  this  address." 

Now  the  address  he  gave  was  the  Hotel  Majestic, 
the  most  fashionable  and  magnificent  of  Vichy's 
palaces.  About  eleven  o'clock  that  night,  when  life 
at  the  hotel  was  at  its  height,  the  manager  sought 
the  writer,  and  announced  the  unexpected  arrival 
of  twenty-seven  enormous  cows  in  the  coiirtyard 
of  the  hotel.  And  there,  sure  enough,  meandering 
in  and  out  of  smart  motor-cars,  lowing  gently 
into  the  ground-floor  windows,  were  the  ex-Sultan's 
latest  purchases.  Where  they  passed  the  night 
the  writer  never  knew,  but  the  next  day  more 
suitable  quarters  were  found  for  them. 

The  Sultan  dined  in  the  great  dining-room  of 
the  Hotel  Majestic.  His  table,  a  very  large  one, 
for  there  were  constant  guests,  was  raised  on  a 
dais  at  one  end  of  the  room,  which  gave  him  an 
excellent  view  of  all  the  diners — and  the  diners 
at  the  Hotel  Majestic  at  Vichy  in  the  height  of  the 
season  are  worth  seeing.  One  night  the  Sultan 
appeared  "  distrait "  at  dinner,  and  his  eye  roved 
over  the  crowded  room  with  an  anxious  and 
sympathetic  expression.  He  spoke  little,  and  it 
was  difficult  to  get  him  to  talk.  At  last  he  asked 
to  see  the  manager,  and  that  most  amiable  and 
deservedly  popular  gentleman,  the  proprietor  of 
the  hotel,  appeared  at  once.  "  These  people," 
said  the  Sultan,  waving  his  hand  toward  the 
crowd  at  dinner,  "  are  badly  distributed.  Many 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  171 

are  not  happy.  Let  us  rearrange  them.  The  old 
gentleman  with  the  long  grey  beard  has  no  right 
to  be  dining  with  the  beautiful  young  lady  in  the 
big  black  hat,  wearing  a  pearl  necklace.  There 
is  a  terrible  disparity  in  their  ages.  She  should 
be  dining  with  the  charming  young  officer  over 
there  " — he  pointed  to  another  table, — "  and  the 
elderly  lady,  no  doubt  his  mother,  should  be  dining 
with  old  greybeard.  You  should  have  " — and  he 
addressed  the  proprietor — "  some  thought  for  the 
happiness  of  your  guests.  Now  that  lady  there  " 
— and  again  he  pointed  in  another  direction — "  is 
terribly  bored.  She  has  been  tapping  the  edge  of 
her  plate  with  her  fork  for  half  an  hour.  She 
evidently  dislikes  extremely  the  gentleman  with 
whom  she  is  dining — probably  her  husband, — but 
I  have  watched  her,  and  she  keeps  looking  at  the 
young  man  dining  alone  with  the  waxed  mous- 
taches. Go  and  introduce  them.  Her  husband 
hasn't  spoken  to  her  once  this  evening.  He  won't 
miss  her — and  you  will  make  two  people  happy ; 
and  if  the  husband  is  dull,  invite  that  strange  lady 
with  the  red  hair,  who  is  just  coming  in,  to  sit 
down  beside  him.  She  will  keep  him  occupied,  I 
expect,  to  judge  by  her  appearance." 

But,  alas  !  interesting  as  such  an  experiment 
would  have  been,  it  was  impossible. 

The  first  few  days  of  the  ex-Sultan's  visit  were 
wet  and  cloudy,  but  one  morning  the  August  sun 
asserted  itself  with  uncompromising  efficiency. 
The  villa  reception-rooms  faced  south-east,  and 
by  eight  o'clock  in  the  morning  were  insufferably 


172  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

hot,  for  the  Sultan  refused  to  close  the  outside 
shutters,  as  he  liked  to  see  and  to  be  seen.  Half 
an  hour  later  he  decided  to  change  his  quarters. 
On  the  opposite  side  of  the  road  was  a  charming 
villa,  in  the  deepest  shade,  with  a  balcony  on  the 
first  floor  wreathed  in  flowering  creepers.  Order- 
ing his  slaves  to  follow  him,  the  ex-Sultan  strode 
across  the  road,  entered  the  villa,  and  found  his 
way  to  the  upstairs  room  with  the  balcony.  It 
was  gorgeous  but  empty.  An  immense  bed,  which 
had  evidently  been  slept  in,  stood  with  its  head 
against  the  wall.  A  word  from  His  Majesty  and 
the  bed  was  wheeled  by  the  slaves  into  the  window 
which  opened  on  to  the  balcony,  and,  arranging 
the  silk  quilt  and  the  lace-fringed  pillows,  the 
ex-Sultan  seated  himself  cross-legged,  gazing  down 
into  the  street  below. 

Now  the  Russian  lady  of  title  who  had  occupied 
the  bed  had  retired  a  few  moments  previously 
into  her  adjacent  cabinet  de  toilette  to  take  her 
morning  bath.  Her  ablutions  completed,  but  not 
clad  for  a  reception,  she  entered  her  room  to  find 
a  dusky  oriental  potentate,  with  his  still  more 
dusky  slaves,  in  possession.  The  ex-Sultan's 
politeness  was  extreme.  He  bade  her  welcome, 
and  invited  her  to  sit  down  beside  him. 

An  overflowing  sense  of  humour  on  the  part 
of  the  lady  saved  a  situation  which  might  other- 
wise have  been  embarrassing,  and  when  the 
writer,  hastily  summoned,  arrived,  the  lady,  now 
more  suitably  arrayed,  and  her  husband  were 
thoroughly  enjoying  the  novelty  of  the  situation. 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  173 

Mulai  Hafid  was  often  bored  with  such  official 
functions  as  his  position  and  his  duty  necessitated 
his  attending.  At  a  dinner  given  at  a  large  pro- 
vincial town  within  motoring  distance  of  Vichy, 
he  made  his  first  public  speech  in  France.  He 
certainly  had  great  fluency,  and  spoke  well — in 
Arabic,  of  course,  his  words  being  immediately 
translated  into  French.  When,  with  tears  in  his 
eyes,  he  explained  his  love  and  gratitude  to 
France — whose  policy  in  Morocco  he  had  all  his 
reign  done  his  best  to  wreck — he  was  really 
immense.  Never  did  words  bear  a  more  genuine 
ring ;  never  was  deep  affection  more  apparent 
in  a  speaker's  voice.  But  Mulai  Hafid  must  not 
be  misjudged.  He  had  learnt  much  during  his 
stay  in  France,  and  had  probably  realised  long 
before  this  episode  how  much  more  successful  a 
Sultan  of  Morocco  he  would  have  been  had  he 
followed  more  strictly  and  more  sincerely  the 
advice  of  his  French  advisers.  But  the  Germans 
had  been  always  at  hand,  with  their  intrigues  and 
their  incentives,  with  vague  promises  and  much 
ready  money,  and  with  their  recommendations  to 
absolutism  and  to  cruelty.  On  one  occasion  the 
Governments  of  Europe  officially,  through  their 
Consuls  at  Fez,  protested  to  Mulai  Hafid  their 
abhorrence  of  the  barbarities  he  had  been  per- 
petrating. The  German  Consul  was  noticeable  by 
his  absence.  Berlin  deliberately  refused  to  protest, 
and  its  representative  at  Fez  was  instructed  to 
inform  the  Sultan  that  his  Government  considered 
that  His  Majesty  had  a  perfect  right  to  do  what  he 


174  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

pleased,  and  advised  him  to  pay  no  regard  to  the 
protest  of  the  Consuls  of  Great  Britain,  France, 
and  Spain  speaking  in  the  names  of  their  respective 
Governments  and  in  the  interests  of  civilisation. 
But,  happily,  Germany  has  paid  dearly  in  Morocco 
for  her  sins  in  the  past.  It  is  a  closed  country  for 
her  to-day,  and  her  people  are  rightly  looked  upon 
as  outcasts  and  outlaws. 

Successful  as  Mulai  Hafid's  first  public  utter- 
ances were,  these  long  and  ceremonious  dinners 
profoundly  bored  him.  As  many  as  he  could  he 
escaped,  but  some  he  had  to  attend.  He  took 
the  strongest  dislike  to  the  "  Prefets  " — a  title 
that,  in  the  functions  of  the  post,  resembles  our 
"  Mayor."  He  always  had  to  sit  on  the  Prefet's 
right,  and  he  complained  that  they  were  pompous 
and  dull. 

When  the  programme  of  his  journey  to  other 
parts  of  France  was  being  drawn  up,  he  was  asked 
what  towns  he  would  like  to  visit.  It  was  one  of 
his  "  off "  days — he  was  silent  and  depressed. 
He  said  he  didn't  care  where,  or  when,  or  how  he 
travelled.  No  amount  of  pressing  could  get  a  direct 
answer  from  him  ;  but  the  official  of  the  French 
Home  Office  could  not  return  to  Paris  without  a 
reply.  Urged  finally  to  give  some  idea,  however 
vague,  of  where  he  would  like  to  go,  the  ex-Sultan 
answered  wearily,  "  Anywhere — to  any  town  that 
has  no  '  Prefet.' "  Many  other  distinguished 
travellers  must  have  often  felt  the  same,  but  few 
probably  ever  dared  to  avow  it. 

Mulai  Hafid  was  by  no  means  always  in  low 


THE   MOORISH   COURT  175 

spirits.  On  one  occasion  we  made  a  long  motor 
trip  to  a  famous  watering-place,  and  after  an 
official  luncheon  we  ascended  a  neighbouring  peak 
in  a  sort  of  funicular  railway.  In  the  railway 
carriage  was  a  frock-coated  and  top-hatted  gentle- 
man of  irreproachable  get-up — a  typical  French 
fonctionnaire  —  polite,  deferential,  and  with  an 
official  smile  that  must  have  taken  a  long  time  to 
acquire.  Speaking  through  an  interpreter,  he 
informed  Mulai  Hafid  that  he  was  charged  by  the 
French  Government  to  accompany  and  point  out 
to  His  Majesty  the  beauties  and  spots  of  interest 
of  the  local  scenery.  Mulai  Hand,  in  an  equally 
polite  reply,  thanked  him,  but  hinted  that  he 
already  had  in  his  suite  some  one  who  knew  the 
country  extremely  well,  who  would  be  only  too 
pleased  to  assist  in  giving  the  required  information, 
and  he  suddenly  presented  the  writer  to  the  French 
official.  Needless  to  say,  I  had  never  been 
within  a  hundred  miles  of  the  place,  and  had 
no  idea  whatever  of  its  beauties,  its  historical 
associations,  and  even  less  of  its  geological  forma- 
tion. I  appreciated,  however,  one  thing :  that 
Mulai  Hafid  meant  to  play  a  practical  joke  on  the 
suave  and  black-gloved  functionary. 

The  train  started  and  began  the  steep  ascent. 
Mulai  Hafid,  innocently  seated  between  the  French 
official  and  the  writer,  asked,  "  What  are  those 
rocks  ?  "  Before  the  authorised  and  official  guide 
could  reply,  the  writer  had  begun,  "  Those  rocks 
are  of  the  tertiary  period,  and  contain  many 
interesting  remains :  the  skeletons  of  mammoths 


176  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

have  been  frequently  found  there,  as  well  as  the 
household  utensils — a  corkscrew  amongst  others — 
of  primitive  man."  The  poor  functionary,  too 
polite  to  protest,  scarcely  showed  his  astonishment, 
except  in  a  furtive  look  in  my  direction.  "  And 
that  wood  ?  "  continued  the  ex-Sultan.  "  That 
wood,"  I  went  on,  "  was  the  scene  of  the  eating 
by  a  bear  of  the  children  who  mocked  at  Elisha." 
This  time  the  functionary  gave  a  little  start. 
Farther  up  the  line  were  the  ruins  of  what  had 
once  probably  been  a  wooden  shed  perched  on 
a  high  rock.  "  And  that  ?  "  asked  the  Sultan. 
"  That,"  replied  the  writer,  "is  all  that  remains 
of  Noah's  Ark,  which  came  to  rest  here  after  the 
subsiding  of  the  Flood."  But  the  functionary 
was  now  only  too  palpably  suffering  tortures. 
He  was  on  an  official  mission  and  terribly  serious. 
He  could  not  see  that  the  episode  was  a  joke, 
and  seemed  sincerely  to  believe  that  Mulai  Hafid, 
the  guest  of  the  French  Republic,  was  being 
purposely  deceived.  "  It  may  have  been,"  he 
began  politely,  "  that  local  tradition  at  some  period 
claimed  this  spot  as  the  resting-place  of  the  Ark — 
of  that  I  know  nothing — but  historical  facts  have 
clearly  proved  that  it  was  elsewhere  that  that 
interesting  event  took  place." 

A  few  nights  later  a  gala  performance  of  Meyer- 
beer's '  Roma  '  was  given  in  the  ex-Sultan's  honour 
at  the  Opera.  Now,  singing  in  Morocco  is  a  nasal 
monotonous  repetition  of  words,  with  little  ex- 
pression and  no  gesture.  The  "  basso "  in  the 
opera  was  an  extremely  corpulent  gentleman,  with 


THE  MOORISH  COURT  177 

a  voice  like  thunder,  accompanied  by  wild  gesticu- 
lations. A  few  bars  of  recitative  by  the  orchestra, 
and  his  great  voice  burst  out  and  filled  the  theatre. 
To  the  Sultan  the  effect  had  nothing  in  common 
with  music,  and  all  he  could  imagine  was  that  the 
performer  was  suffering  intense  unbearable  pain, 
more  especially  as  the  louder  he  sang  the  more 
he  waved  his  arms  about  and  beat  his  capacious 
stomach. 

Springing  to  his  feet,  His  Majesty  cried,  "  Where 

is  Dr  V ?  "  (Dr  V was  his  English  doctor, 

who  had  accompanied  him  on  his  visit  to  France) 

— "  where  is  Dr  V ?  Find  him  quickly,  some 

one.  He  may  be  able  to  save  his  life  "  ;  and  with 
an  expression  of  terrible  anxiety  the  ex-Sultan's 
eyes  alternately  gazed  fascinated  at  the  singer 
or  sought  for  the  doctor  in  the  gloomy  recesses 
of  the  royal  box.  It  was  not  without  difficulty 
that  His  Majesty  was  persuaded  that  the  singer 
was  suffering  no  pain ;  but  that  he  was  actually 
supposed  to  be  giving  pleasure  to  the  audience  he 
entirely  refused  to  believe. 

The  ex-Sultan  was  bored,  and  left  the  theatre 
before  the  end.  The  following  morning  he  asked 
me  what  had  taken  place  in  the  last  act,  and  on 
being  told  of  the  terrible  fate  that  almost  all  the 
characters  in  the  tragedy  had  suffered,  he  replied, 
"  I  am  sorry  I  did  not  stay.  I  should  have  sent  for 
the  manager  and  insisted  that  the  piece  should 
end  happily.  The  young  lady  should  have  married 
the  soldier  with  the  big  sword.  The  blind  woman 
should  have  had  her  sight  restored  by  an  able

doctor,  and  no  one  should  have  been  stabbed  or 
built  up  in  a  tomb." 

It  was  perhaps  as  well  that  he  didn't  stay  till 
the  end,  for  his  amiable  intervention  might  have 
disturbed  the  tragic  climax  of  the  opera. 


RAISULI. 

I. 

MULAI  AHMED  BEN  MOHAMMED  ER-RAISTJLI  is  to- 
day a  man  of  about  fifty  years  of  age.  He  is  by 
birth  sprung  from  one  of  the  most  aristocratic 
families  in  Morocco,  and  is  a  Shereef,  or  direct 
descendant  of  the  Prophet,  through  Mulai  Idris, 
who  founded  the  Mohammedan  Empire  of  Morocco, 
and  was  the  first  sovereign  of  the  Idrisite  Dynasty. 
The  children  of  Mulai  Idris  were  established  in 
various  parts  of  the  country,  and  it  is  from  Mulai 
Abd  es-Salam,  whose  tomb  in  the  Beni  Aros  tribe 
is  a  place  of  great  sanctity,  that  the  famous 
brigand  is  directly  descended — his  family,  and  he 
himself,  still  holding  a  share  in  the  lands,  the 
rights  and  the  privileges  which  were  enjoyed  by 
their  renowned  ancestor.  A  branch  of  the  family 
settled  in  Tetuan,  where  a  fine  mosque  forms  a 
mausoleum  for  his  more  recent  ancestors,  and  is 
venerated  as  a  place  of  pilgrimage. 

Possibly  it  was  this  holy  ancestry  that  turned 
Raisuli  from  the  paths  of  virtue,  for  after  having 
received  an  excellent  education  in  religion  and 
religious  law  at  Tetuan,  he  took  to  the  adventurous, 


180  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

lucrative,  and  in  Morocco  by  no  means  despised, 
profession  of  a  cattle  robber.  It  is  a  risky  business, 
and  requires  courage.  You  may  just  as  likely 
be  shot  yourself  as  shoot  any  one  else ;  but  pres- 
tige tells  in  favour  of  the  head  of  the  band,  and  a 
reign  of  terror  of  the  young  Raisuli  ensued.  He 
became  celebrated.  He  was  a  youth  of  great 
courage,  of  the  most  prepossessing  looks,  and  he 
and  his  followers  earned  money  easily  and  fast — 
and  spent  it  still  faster.  But  cattle  robberies  led 
to  other  crimes.  Murders  followed,  and  it  must 
be  confessed  that  Raisuli' s  hands  are  none  too 
clean  in  that  respect ;  but  murder  in  Morocco 
cannot  be  classed  with  murder  in  England.  Life 
is  cheap,  and  the  dead  are  soon  forgotten.  By 
nature  he  was,  and  is,  cruel,  and  the  profession 
he  had  adopted  gave  him  unlimited  scope  to 
exhibit  his  cruelty.  On  one  occasion  a  Shereef 
who  had  married  his  sister  proposed,  according 
to  Moslem  custom,  to  take  a  second  wife.  Raisuli's 
sister,  enraged,  fled  to  her  brother  and  com- 
plained. Nothing  occurred  till  the  night  of  the 
new  marriage,  when  at  the  height  of  the  festivities 
Raisuli  and  his  men  entered  his  brother-in-law's 
house  and  put  to  death  the  young  bride  and  her 
mother. 

At  length  his  acts  became  insupportable.  The 
whole  country  round  lived  in  terror  of  his  raids. 
The  late  Sultan  ordered  his  arrest.  His  greatest 
friend  betrayed  him ;  he  was  seized,  and  sent  to 
prison  in  the  dreaded  dungeons  of  Mogador. 
When,  in  1903,  I  was  Raisuli's  prisoner  at  Zinat, 


RAISULI  181 

he  narrated  more  than  once  to  me  the  history  of 
those  four  or  five  years  spent  in  prison.  He  * 
showed  me  the  marks  of  the  chains  on  his  ankles, 
wrists,  and  neck ;  he  told  me  of  the  filth  and  the 
cold ;  of  the  introduction  of  a  file  in  a  loaf  of 
bread ;  of  five  months'  patient  work  at  night ; 
and  of  a  delayed  flight.  He  escaped,  but  for  a 
very  few  hours.  He  did  not  know  his  way  about 
the  town,  and  he  had  forgotten  that  the  chains 
would  almost  prevent  his  walking.  He  entered 
a  street  that  had  no  outlet,  and  was  recaptured. 
Fresh  chains  were  heaped  upon  him,  and  it  was 
not  till  two  years  later  that  he  was  released  on  the 
petition  of  Haj  Mohammed  Torres,  the  Sultan's 
representative  at  Tangier.  He  came  back  to  his 
home,  meaning  to  live  a  quiet  and  peaceful  life, 
but  he  found  that  his  friend  who  had  betrayed 
him  had  become  Governor  of  Tangier,  and  con- 
fiscated all  his  property.  He  applied  for  its 
return,  but  could  not  obtain  it.  He  threatened, 
but  they  laughed  at  him — and  then  he  took  to  his 
old  profession  and  became  a  brigand. 

It  was  at  this  period  that  I  first  met  him.  I 
was  camping  on  a  shooting  expedition  near  Arzeila, 
when  he  and  his  men  paid  me  a  visit  and  spent 
the  night  at  my  camp.  I  confess  that  his  person- 
ality was  almost  fascinating.  Tall,  remarkably 
handsome,  with  the  whitest  of  skins,  a  short  dark 
beard  and  moustache,  and  black  eyes,  with  profile 
Greek  rather  than  Semitic,  and  eyebrows  that 
formed  a  straight  line  across  his  forehead,  Mulai 
Ahmed  er-Raisuli  was  a  typical  and  ideal  bandit. 


182  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

His  manner  was  quiet,  his  voice  soft  and  low, 
and  his  expression  particularly  sad.  He  smiled 
sometimes,  but  seldom,  and  even  though  I  knew 
him  much  better  later  on,  I  never  heard  him  laugh. 
With  his  followers  he  was  cold  and  haughty,  and 
they  treated  him  with  all  the  respect  due  to  his 
birth. 

When  next  I  saw  him  I  was  his  prisoner  at  his 
stronghold  at  Zinat,  situated  about  twelve  miles 
from  Tangier — in  June  1903.  He  had  altered  a 
littta  His  face  had  filled  out,  the  mouth  had 


become  harder  and  a  little  more  cruel,  but  he  was 
still  remarkably  handsome.  He  had  not  changed 
for  the  better.  Only  a  few  months  before  my 
capture  he  had  sold  one  of  his  prisoners  to  an 
enemy  for  $1500,  and  stood  by  to  see  the  pur- 
chaser cut  the  victim's  throat.  As  long  as  he  had 
restricted  his  energies  to  cattle-lifting  and  to 
attacks  upon  natives  no  one  paid  very  serious 
attention  to  him,  though  the  Maghzen  were  trying 
to  encompass  his  capture.  On  16th  June  1903  the 
Shereefian  troops  attacked  and  burnt  Zinat ;  the 
same  afternoon  I  was  captured. 

Hearing  that  a  battle  had  taken  place  at  that 
spot,  situated  some  eight  or  nine  miles  away,  I 
rode  out  toward  the  middle  of  the  day  in  that 
direction,  accompanied  by  my  native  groom,  whose 
parents  lived  at  Zinat,  and  who  was  most  anxious 
as  to  the  safety  of  his  relations.  Already  the  alarm 
had  spread  to  the  neighbouring  villages,  and  we 
found  the  country  round  entirely  deserted,  the 
population  having  fled  to  the  mountains  of  Anjera 


RAISULI  183 

with  all  their  cattle  and  as  much  of  their  goods 
as  they  could  carry  away.  Although  the  attack 
of  the  Government  troops  had  been  made  with 
the  object  of  capturing  Raisuli,  the  native  cavalry 
had  wandered  far  afield  after  loot,  and  a  consider- 
able number  of  cattle,  &c.,  had  been  carried  off 
from  villages  innocent  of  any  rebellious  intentions, 
and  in  no  way  accessories  to  Raisuli' s  depredations. 

I  found  it  difficult  on  this  account  to  obtain 
any  accurate  information  of  what  had  occurred, 
and  a  desire  to  do  so,  coupled  with  my  groom's 
anxiety,  persuaded  me  to  approach  nearer  than 
was  perhaps  advisable  to  the  scene  of  the  morn- 
ing's action.  Skirting  the  stony  hill  on  which 
Zinat  is  situated,  I  entered  the  plain,  crossed  by 
small  gulleys,  that  lies  to  the  south  of  the  villages, 
and  until  within  two  miles  of  the  place  met  with 
no  incident  worth  recording.  The  whole  country 
was  absolutely  deserted.  Not  a  single  person, 
not  a  head  of  cattle,  was  to  be  seen. 

It  was  when  we  were  crossing  this  plain  that 
suddenly  a  volley  was  fired  at  us  from  men  con- 
cealed in  the  brushwood  and  rocks  of  a  small  hill 
near  by.  The  range  was  a  long  one,  and  though 
we  could  hear  the  bullets  whizzing  over  our  heads, 
I  do  not  believe  that  any  passed  us  very  closely. 
Setting  spurs  to  our  horses,  we  cantered  away 
out  of  range,  and  drew  rein  on  an  elevation  in  the 
plain  in  the  midst  of  a  field  of  corn.  Turning  to 
see  what  was  happening,  I  perceived  three  or  four 
natives  a  considerable  distance  away,  who  had 
taken  off  their  cloaks  and  turbans,  and  were 


184  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

waving  to  me  to  return.  This  waving  of  turbans 
is  always  in  Morocco  a  sign  of  "  aman  "  or  safety, 
and  I  therefore  waited  for  the  men,  who  were 
moving  quickly  in  our  direction.  Two  alone 
approached  us,  both  well  known  to  me  ;  and  having 
arrived  at  the  spot  where  we  were  stationed,  they 
apologised  profusely  for  the  mistake  of  their  men 
in  having  fired,  and  begged  me  to  return  with 
them  to  Zinat  to  discuss  the  situation  there. 
They  were  Anjera  men  from  the  neighbouring 
Roman  hills,  who  had  not  been  present  at  the 
battle,  but  who  had  come  down  to  Zinat,  as  the 
irregular  cavalry  had  carried  off  a  considerable 
number  of  their  cattle.  They  stated  that  they 
were  desirous  of  knowing  the  intentions  of  the 
Moorish  Government  with  regard  to  their  tribe. 
If,  they  said,  it  was  the  Government's  intention 
to  attack  them,  they  were  ready  to  resist;  but 
if  the  Moorish  forces  had  been  ordered  merely  to 
capture  Raisuli  and  had  looted  their  property 
without  authority,  they  demanded  the  return  of 
their  cattle — a  very  reasonable  demand.  They 
added  that  they  were  afraid  to  proceed  to  Tangier 
to  interview  the  authorities  for  fear  of  capture  and 
imprisonment  there,  and  asked  me  accordingly  to 
take  their  message  to  the  native  officials,  as  on 
such  occasions  I  had  often  done  before.  Under  a 
promise  of  safety  I  proceeded  with  them  in  the 
direction  of  Zinat,  having  agreed  that  I  should 
go  to  a  spot  near  the  hills  where  three  or  four 
of  the  headmen  of  the  tribe  were  to  meet  me. 
It  was  when  proceeding  in  that  direction  that  I 


RAISULI  185 

was  captured.  We  were  crossing  a  small  gully, 
thick  with  crimson-blossomed  oleanders,  when  sud- 
denly I  discovered  that  I  had  fallen  into  an 
ambush.  Flight  was  impossible,  and  as  I  was 
unarmed,  resistance  was  out  of  the  question. 
From  every  side  sprung  out  tribesmen,  and  in  a 
second  or  two  I  was  a  prisoner,  surrounded  by 
thirty  or  forty  men,  one  and  all  armed  with 
European  rifles.  I  received  no  rough  treatment 
at  their  hands,  but  was  told  that  I  was  their 
prisoner  and  must  proceed  to  Zinat.  On  arrival 
at  the  woods  which  surround  the  several  villages 
which  lie  scattered  on  the  Zinat  hills,  messengers 
were  sent  to  inform  Raisuli  of  my  capture,  and 
in  a  short  time  I  was  taken  to  him.  He  was 
seated  under  some  olive-trees  in  a  little  gully, 
surrounded  by  his  men  and  by  the  headmen 
of  the  neighbouring  tribes,  who  had  collected  on 
learning  what  had  taken  place.  Raisuli  received., 
me  pleasantly  enough.  He  was  still  a  young 
man  of  handsome  appearance,  refined  in  feature 
and  manner,  and  with  a  pleasant  voice.  He 
was  dressed  in  the  costume  of  the  mountain  tribes, 
a  short  brown  cloak  covering  his  white  linen  k 
clothes  and  reaching  only  to  the  knees,  with  a 
turban  of  dark-blue  cloth.  His  legs  were  bare, 
and  he  wore  the  usual  yellow  slippers  of  the  country. 
After  a  short  talk  with  Raisuli,  who  narrated  to 
me  all  that  had  taken  place,  he  led  me  to  what 
remained  of  his  house,  the  greater  part  of  which 
had  been  burned  by  the  troops.  Up  to  this  time 
I  had  nothing  to  complain  of  in  the  attitude  of  the 


186  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

tribesmen,  but  a  great  number  had  collected  in 
the  vicinity,  all  anxious  to  catch  a  glimpse  of  the 
Christian  captive,  and  not  a  few  inclined  to  wreak 
summary  vengeance  on  me  for  the  devastation  the 
Government  troops  had  committed  in  the  place. 
There  was  a  good  deal  of  hooting  and  cursing, 
but  Raisuli's  influence  was  sufficient  for  him  to 
be  able  to  hurry  me  through  the  crowd,  now  very 
threatening,  and  his  own  followers  closed  round 
me  and  guarded  me  from  the  mountaineers.  It 
was  an  unpleasant  moment,  for  I  soon  perceived 
that  no  authority  existed  over  this  collection  of 
tribesmen,  who  numbered  at  this  time  perhaps 
2000 — though  by  nightfall  this  number  was  pro- 
bably doubled, — and  that  there  would  be  no  possi- 
bility of  protection  did  they  proceed  to  extremes. 
It  was  with  no  little  relief  that  I  saw  the  door  of 
a  small  room  in  the  remaining  portion  of  Raisuli's 
house  opened,  through  which  I  was  pushed  in.  A 
moment  later  it  was  closed  again,  but  it  seemed  as 
though  the  crowd  without  would  break  it  down. 
But  Raisuli  and  his  men,  and  a  score  of  personal 
friends  amongst  the  tribesmen,  formed  up  against 
the  doorway  outside,  and  were  able  to  dissuade  the 
rabble  from  their  intention  of  dragging  me  out. 

The  room  in  which  I  found  myself  was  very 
dark,  light  being  admitted  only  by  one  small 
window  near  the  roof,  and  it  was  some  time 
before  my  eyes  became  accustomed  to  the  gloom. 
When  I  was  able  to  see  more  clearly,  the  first 
object  that  attracted  my  eyes  was  a  body  lying 
in  the  middle  of  the  room.  It  was  the  corpse  of 


RAISULI  187 

a  man  who  had  been  killed  there  in  the  morning 
by  the  troops,  and  formed  a  ghastly  spectacle. 
Stripped  of  all  clothing  and  shockingly  mutilated, 
the  body  lay  with  extended  arms.  The  head  had 
been  roughly  hacked  off,  and  the  floor  all  round 
was  swimming  in  blood.  The  soldiers  had  carried 
off  the  head  in  triumph  as  a  trophy  of  war,  and 
they  had  wiped  their  gory  fingers  on  the  white- 
washed walls,  leaving  bloodstains  everywhere. 
However,  I  was  not  to  suffer  the  company  of  the 
corpse  for  long,  for  half  a  dozen  men  came  in, 
washed  the  body,  sewed  it  up  in  its  winding-sheet, 
and  carried  it  away  for  burial ;  and  a  little  later 
the  floor  was  washed  down,  though  no  attempt 
was  made  to  move  the  bloody  finger-marks  from 
the  wall. 

Here  I  remained  alone  for  some  hours,  and  it 
was  certainly  an  anxious  time.  I  reviewed  the 
situation  quietly,  and  came  to  the  conclusion 
that,  in  spite  of  the  danger  which  I  knew  existed, 
I  had  much  in  my  favour.  The  fact  that  the 
language  of  the  people  was  almost  the  same  to 
me  as  my  own  tongue  was  a  great  assistance, 
and  amongst  these  mountain  tribes  I  have  a  large 
number  of  personal  friends,  who,  I  believed,  and 
rightly,  would  protect  me  as  far  as  they  were 
able.  Unfortunately,  few  of  my  influential 
acquaintances  amongst  the  mountaineers  had 
arrived,  though  to  my  joy  I  learned,  from  the 
conversation  of  the  guards  outside  the  door,  that 
they  were  expected  during  the  coming  night.  I 
decided  meanwhile  to  pretend  absolute  ignorance 


188  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

of  any  danger,  and  to  talk  of  my  condition  as 
only  one  of  a  series  of  adventures  that  I  have 
undergone  in  Morocco  and  elsewhere. 

At  sundown  Raisuli  and  some  of  his  men  brought 
me  food,  and  I  had  a  long  conversation  with  them. 
Raisuli  was  polite,  and  made  no  secret  that  he 
intended  to  make  use  of  me,  though  he  had  not 
yet  decided  in  what  way.  He,  however,  kindly 
informed  me  that,  should  the  attack  of  the  troops 
be  renewed,  I  should  be  immediately  killed.  His 
career,  he  said,  was  practically  finished,  and  his 
sole  desire  was  to  cause  the  Moorish  Government 
as  much  trouble  and  humiliation  as  possible,  and 
he  argued  that  there  would  be  no  easier  way  to 
do  this  than  by  causing  my  death.  However, 
he  promised  me,  at  the  same  time,  that  provided 
no  fresh  attack  was  made  upon  the  place,  he  would 
do  his  best  to  protect  me.  I  was  allowed  to  com- 
municate with  the  British  Legation,  but  was  not 
aware  till  later  that  this  letter  never  reached  its 
destination,  though  the  following  morning  I  was 
in  direct  communication  with  His  Majesty's  Min- 
ister, and  throughout  my  captivity  no  difficulties 
were  put  in  my  way  in  corresponding  with  the 
British  Legation. 

During  the  night  a  large  contingent  of  the 
Anjera  tribe  arrived,  amongst  them  several  influ- 
ential men  on  whose  friendship  I  felt  I  might 
implicitly  rely ;  and  as  a  matter  of  fact  I  owe  my 
release,  and  probably  my  life,  largely  to  these  men. 

There  is  no  need  to  give  the  details  of  the  nine 
days  that  I  spent  at  Zinat,  sufficient  to  say  that  I 


RAISULI  189 

suffered  very  considerable  hardship.  Though  never 
actually  roughly  handled,  except  for  a  few  insult- 
ing blows  with  slippers,  &c.,  my  discomforts  were 
extreme.  During  those  nine  days  I  was  never 
able  to  wash ;  I  never  took  my  clothes  off,  with 
the  result  that  I  was  smothered  with  vermin. 
Once  I  went  for  thirty-six  hours  without  any  food, 
for  none  was  procurable,  as  the  village  had  been 
burnt,  and  during  the  whole  time  my  life  was 
threatened.  My  friends  did  what  they  could  for 
me,  but  it  was  little  they  could  do.  There  must 
have  been  some  4000  tribesmen  present,  and  they 
obeyed  no  one,  and  no  one  had  any  authority 
over  them.  It  was  a  trying  time,  but  my  only 
chance  lay  in  pretending  to  place  implicit  confi- 
dence in  them,  and  thus  gain  time  while  the 
negotiations  for  my  release  proceeded. 

No  words  of  praise  are  sufficient  for  the  great 
tact  displayed  by  Sir  Arthur  Nicolson,  the  British 
Minister,  in  conducting  these  negotiations.  From 
the  very  beginning  he  realised  the  difficulties  of 
success,  and  throughout,  in  every  dealing  that  he 
had  with  the  tribesmen,  he  showed  the  greatest 
tact  and  skill.  He  from  the  very  commencement 
warned  the  Moorish  Government  not  to  take  any 
steps  to  treat  with  the  mountaineers,  and  con- 
ducted the  entire  proceedings  himself,  Mulai  Ahmed, 
the  young  Shereef  of  Wazzan,  being  the  means  of 
communication  between  the  British  Government 
and  the  tribesmen.  These  negotiations  were  doubly 
difficult  owing  to  the  fact  that  the  mountaineers 
had  no  recognised  chiefs,  and  that  many  tribes 


190  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

were  concerned.  Yet  in  such  a  manner  were  the 
negotiations  conducted,  that  throughout  the  wiiole 
proceedings  the  ignorant  and  fanatical  tribesmen 
placed  entire  confidence  in  the  Minister's  word, 
and  though  delays  occurred,  as  they  always  do  in 
Morocco,  there  was  never  a  serious  hitch. 

The  first  demand  made  to  me  for  my  release 
was  the  removal  of  all  Englishmen  from  the 
Sultan's  Court.  I  naturally  treated  this  as  pre- 
posterous, and  persuaded  the  tribesmen  that  it 
was  mere  folly  to  mention  it.  This  was  followed 
by  other  equally  impossible  conditions,  which 
were  likewise  abandoned ;  and  by  the  time  that 
the  British  Legation  was  in  communication  with 
the  tribesmen  they  had  lessened  their  demands 
to  the  release  of  a  certain  number  of  tribal  prisoners 
confined  in  the  prisons  of  Tangier  and  Laraiche. 

At  no  time  was  a  demand  made  for  a  ransom 
in  money,  and  in  this  my  capture  differed  entirely 
from  those  of  Mr  Perdicaris  and  Kaid  Maclean, 
which  took  place  later.  I  owe  this  immunity 
from  a  pecuniary  ransom  to  an  admirable  trait 
in  the  character  of  these  wild  mountain  tribes- 
men. My  country-house  at  Tangier  was  situated 
about  two  and  a  half  miles  from  the  town,  on  the 
sea-coast,  on  the  main  track  that  passes  between 
the  An j  era  tribe  and  Tangier.  Just  beyond  my 
grounds,  on  the  town  side,  is  a  tidal  river,  which 
then  and  now  possesses  no  bridge,  but  it  is  ford- 
able  at  low  tide.  Often  the  tribes-people  found 
the  tide  too  high  to  cross,  and  were  obliged  to 
wait  long  weary  hours,  in  winter  at  times  in  dark- 


RAISULI  191 

ness  and  rain.  A  large  number  were  women  and 
young  girls  carrying  loads  of  charcoal  to  market. 
I  had  always  made  it  a  rule  to  give  shelter  to  all 
such  as  asked  for  it,  and  had  built  a  room  or  two 
for  this  purpose,  and  in  winter-time  it  was  seldom 
that  some  of  the  benighted  peasants  were  not 
spending  the  night  there.  When  it  was  cold  and 
wet  they  had  a  fire,  and  as  often  as  not  a  little 
supper.  A  very  short  time  after  my  capture  a 
proposal  was  made  from  Tangier  that  a  very 
considerable  sum  of  money  should  be  paid  for  my 
immediate  release.  This  was  discussed  by  the 
tribesmen  and  refused.  They  decided  that  in 
the  case  of  one  who  had  shown  such  hospitality 
to  their  women  and  children,  and  often  to  them- 
selves, there  must  be  no  question  of  money — and 
there  was  none. 

There  was  one  hitch  which  threatened  to  break 
down  our  negotiations,  and  which  caused  some 
delay  to  my  release. 

It  had  been  agreed  that  twelve  prisoners  from 
the  tribesmen,  confined  in  various  Moorish  Govern- 
ment prisons,  were  to  be  released  in  exchange  for 
myself ;  but  after  a  very  numerously-attended 
meeting,  at  which  a  large  number  of  fresh  moun- 
taineers arrived,  a  demand  was  made  for  the  release 
of  over  fifty.  The  British  Legation  was  notified 
of  this,  and  very  rightly  objected  to  this  sudden 
and  very  large  addition.  Sir  Arthur  Nicolson 
wrote  me  to  this  effect.  Before,  however,  making 
known  the  contents  of  his  letter,  I  obtained  the 
names  of  all  the  fifty  tribesmen  whose  release  was 


192  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

demanded,  and  sent  the  list  to  Tangier,  pretending 
that  it  was  to  be  submitted  to  the  authorities, 
in  order  that  in  the  case  of  its  acceptance,  orders 
for  the  release  of  the  men  might  be  given.  Once 
this  letter  well  on  its  way,  I  made  known  to  the 
tribesmen  that  on  no  account  more  than  the 
original  twelve  prisoners  would  be  released.  At  first 
they  tried  persuasion,  and  then  threats — but  I  felt 
sure  of  my  position.  "  You  propose,"  I  said,  "  to 
kill  me.  Possibly  you  will  do  so,  but  you  have 
kindly  given  me  a  list  of  all  your  relations  who 
are  in  the  Moorish  prison — some  fifty-six  in  all, 
I  think.  This  list  is  now  in  Tangier.  You  will 
have  the  satisfaction  of  killing  me,  but  remember 
this — on  fifty-six  consecutive  days  one  of  your 
sons  or  brothers  or  nephews  will  be  executed — 
one  each  morning ;  and  more — their  bodies  will 
be  burnt  and  the  ashes  scattered  to  the  wind. 
You  will  see  the  smoke  from  here  " — for  Tangier 
was  visible  from  where  we  were.  Now,  the  Moors 
believe  in  a  corporeal  resurrection,  and  the  burn- 
ing of  a  body  means  the  depriving  of  the  soul  of 
resurrection.  It  was  a  splendid  bluff,  and  I  felt 
the  greatest  delight  in  using  it.  I  was  there  alone, 
seated  in  the  centre  of  a  great  circle  of  the  tribes- 
men, who  swore  and  cursed  and  threatened ;  but 
to  no  avail.  I  even  explained  that  it  was  a  matter 
of  no  importance  in  the  Christian  religion  what 
became  of  one  body — and  pointed  out  the  conse- 
quent loss  of  fifty-six  good  Moslem  souls,  deprived 
of  going  to  heaven.  I  was  successful.  The  tribes- 
men returned  to  their  original  demand. 


RAISULI  193 

In  all  my  dealings  with  the  Moors  I  have  found 
this,  that  the  intelligent  European,  provided  he 
has  a  complete  and  absolute  knowledge  of  the 
language,  holds  a  very  distinct  advantage  over 
the  Moor.  He  has,  in  fact,  two  advantages — her- 
editary training  of  thought,  and  education.  The 
Moor  is  generally,  by  his  environment  and  isola- 
tion, a  slow  thinker,  and  in  the  many  difficult 
situations  in  which  I  at  times  found  myself  I  have 
always  had  confidence  in  my  own  mental  superi- 
ority over  the  average  native.  I  have  been  able 
to  turn  threats  into  ridicule,  or  to  raise  a  laugh, 
or  to  persuade  by  the  mere  superiority  of  the 
power  of  thinking  and  of  giving  utterance  to  one's 
thoughts.  The  Moor  is  very  susceptible  to  sarcasm 
and  ridicule,  and  often  I  have  turned  what  looked 
like  becoming  a  stormy  incident  into  the  pleasantest 
of  channels.  I  have,  almost  without  exception, 
carried  no  arms,  which  are  often  more  a  source 
of  danger  than  of  security. 

The  only  time  that  I  left  my  quarters  at  Zinat 
for  more  than  a  few  minutes  together  was  on  one 
occasion,  a  few  days  after  my  arrival,  when  I  was 
taken  down  to  a  gully  below  the  village  to  be  shown 
the  corpse  of  a  Moorish  cavalry  soldier  who  had 
been  killed  during  the  engagement.  In  revenge 
for  the  beheading  of  the  Zinat  man  who  had  been 
killed,  the  tribesmen  had  mutilated  the  soldier's 
body.  It  was  a  ghastly  sight.  The  summer  heat 
had  already  caused  the  corpse  to  discolour  and 
swell.  An  apple  had  been  stuck  in  the  man's 
mouth,  and  both  his  eyes  had  been  gouged  out. 

N 


194  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

The  naked  body  was  shockingly  mutilated,  and  the 
finger-tips  had  been  cut  off,  to  be  worn,  the  tribes- 
men told  me,  as  charms  by  their  women.  The 
hands  were  pegged  to  the  ground  by  sticks  driven 
through  the  palms,  about  a  yard  in  length,  bearing 
little  flags.  A  wreath  of  wild  flowers  was  twined 
round  the  miserable  man's  head,  and  the  village 
dogs  had  already  gnawed  away  a  portion  of  the 
flesh  of  one  of  the  legs.  I  was  jokingly  informed 
that  that  was  probably  what  I  should  look  like 
during  the  course  of  the  next  few  days. 

During  the  entire  nine  days  that  I  was  at  Zinat 
I  was  no  doubt  always  in  danger,  and  certainly 
always  in  great  discomfort ;  but  I  had  used  every 
opportunity  to  bring  the  friendly  tribe  of  Anjera 
over  to  my  side,  and  on  the  night  of  the  ninth  day 
my  friends  rose  nobly  to  the  occasion.  They 
surrounded  Raisuli's  house  and  village  with  per- 
haps a  thousand  men,  all  armed  and  prepared, 
and  demanded  that  I  should  be  handed  over  to 
them,  threatening  that,  if  this  were  not  immediately 
carried  out,  they  would  shoot  or  arrest  Raisuli. 
It  was  a  little  coup-d'etat,  and  it  was  successful. 
In  the  middle  of  the  night  I  was  hustled  out  of 
the  small  room  which  I  shared  with  a  dozen 
guards,  placed  on  the  back  of  a  mule,  and  carried 
off  into  the  Anjera  mountains  by  my  friends  of 
that  tribe.  For  six  hours  we  proceeded  through 
mountain  passes  and  thick  brushwood,  arriving 
soon  after  sunrise  at  the  village  of  Sheikh  Duas, 
one  of  the  most  influential  of  the  Anjera  tribesmen. 
It  was  a  journey  I  will  never  forget — the  dark- 


RAISULI  195 

ness  of  the  moonless  night,  the  rough  mountain 
tracks,  the  silence  of  the  hundreds  of  armed  men 
who  accompanied  me,  and  the  intense  relief  that, 
even  if  my  captivity  was  long  protracted,  I  was 
amongst  men  who  would,  at  any  rate,  protect  my 
life.  I  was  tired  and  weak.  Nine  days  of  constant 
strain,  in  great  heat,  on  a  diet  of  inferior  dry  bread 
and  water,  with  the  necessity  the  whole  time  of 
pretending  rather  to  enjoy  the  situation  than 
otherwise,  had  worn  me  out.  But  from  the  friendly 
tribe  of  Anjera  I  received  nothing  but  kindness — 
every  word,  every  act  of  theirs  was  cheering  and 
thoughtful ;  and  though  life  among  them  was 
rough  enough  in  its  way,  I  owe  them  a  debt  of 
gratitude  that  it  will  be  difficult  ever  to  repay. 
I  remained  twelve  days  at  Sheikh  Duas's  village 
in  the  Anjera  mountains,  and  throughout  that 
period  I  never  suffered  an  indignity  or  an  insult 
from  him  or  his  people.  A  little  room  in  his  house 
was  put  at  my  disposal,  and  infinite  pains  were 
taken  to  render  it  clean  and  habitable.  The  best 
of  such  food  as  was  procurable  was  given  me — 
milk  and  cream-cheese,  and  a  rough  porridge  of 
sour  milk  and  millet.  His  followers — for  Duas  is 
not  above  being  a  cattle  robber  on  a  large  scale 
— helped  me  to  pass  my  time  pleasantly  enough, 
and  with  them  I  explored  the  neighbouring  moun- 
tains, and  sat  in  the  shade  of  the  fruit  trees  of 
their  little  gardens  listening  to  their  local  musicians 
or  watching  the  ungraceful  movements  of  their 
dancing-girls.  I  made  friends  there  whose  friend- 
ship I  shall  always  value.  I  was  treated  as  one  of 


196  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

the  tribe.  I  wore  their  dress,  shaved  my  head, 
and  conformed  to  all  their  customs  ;  but  above 
and  beyond  all,  my  anxiety  was  at  an  end — I 
knew  that  I  was  out  of  grave  danger. 

Meanwhile  the  British  Minister,  ably  assisted  by 
the  Shereef  of  Wazzan,  was  carrying  on  the  negoti- 
ations. Although  I  was  now  amongst  friends,  these 
negotiations  were  delicate  and  difficult,  for  the 
Anjera  tribe  had  given  their  word  to  the  other 
tribes  concerned  not  to  release  me  until  their 
prisoners  were  set  free,  and  these  other  tribes 
were  constantly  desirous  of  changing  their  condi- 
tions, and,  owing  to  the  distances  which  separated 
them,  this  necessarily  meant  delay.  The  very  fact 
that  I  was  now  some  twenty-seven  miles — a  day's 
journey — from  Tangier  protracted  the  negotiations. 
Several  times  I  seemed  on  the  point  of  release, 
but  some  small  hitch,  unimportant,  it  is  true, 
would  arise  and  a  delay  occur. 

Except  for  this,  time  passed  pleasantly;  the 
scenery  was  delightful,  and  although  it  was  the 
middle  of  summer  the  air  was  cool  at  this  altitude. 
Little  streams  of  water  ran  in  every  direction,  and 
I  was  able  to  bathe  and  be  clean  once  more.  To 
all  intents  and  purposes  I  was  free  to  go  where 
I  pleased,  and  though  always  accompanied  by 
guards,  so  thoughtful  and  kind  were  they  that 
one  forgot  that  they  were  there  to  prevent  my 
escape,  and  we  all  became  the  best  of  friends. 
Meanwhile  the  Shereef  of  Wazzan  spared  himself 
no  trouble.  No  sun  was  too  hot  for  him  to  travel, 
no  journey  too  tiring  for  him  to  undertake.  He 


RAISULI  197 

attended  the  tribal  meetings  and  made  known 
to  the  headman  the  British  Minister's  intentions 
with  regard  to  the  tribal  prisoners,  orders  for  whose 
release  had  meanwhile  been  received  from  the 
Sultan.  His  Majesty's  readiness  to  comply  with 
Sir  Arthur  Nicolson's  request  was  deserving  of  all 
praise,  for  it  must  be  remembered  that  the  action 
of  the  rebels  throughout  was  intended  to  humiliate 
the  Sultan  and  his  Government.  What  rendered 
the  situation  during  my  captivity,  especially  during 
the  first  part  of  it,  doubly  insecure  was  the  fact 
that  the  tribes  were  in  active  communication  with 
the  Pretender  to  the  Moorish  Throne — the  leader 
of  the  rebellion  in  the  Rif, — and  it  was  proposed 
over  and  over  again  to  send  me  to  him  as  a  useful 
hostage ;  and,  had  it  not  been  for  my  friendship 
with  the  An j  era  tribe — a  friendship  of  long  stand- 
ing— I  have  no  doubt  this  proposal  would  have 
been  carried  out. 

On  Saturday,  4th  July,  a  large  tribal  meeting 
was  held  near  Sheikh  Duas's  village,  and  during 
the  usual  wrangling  which  occurred  on  these 
occasions  the  Shereef  of  Wazzan  arrived,  having 
travelled  the  twenty-seven  miles  from  Tangier 
that  day,  in  spite  of  the  heat  of  the  July  sun. 
His  opportune  presence  settled  my  fate,  and  the 
negotiations  were  brought  to  a  conclusion,  not 
without  considerable  opposition.  The  following 
day  a  large  contingent  of  tribesmen,  the  Shereef, 
and  I  set  out  for  Tangier,  spending  the  night  some 
twelve  miles  from  that  place.  Even  here  a  last 
attempt  was  made — an  attempt  that  nearly  led 


198  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

to  bloodshed — to  prevent  my  release,  but  happily 
unsuccessfully.  The  next  morning  we  moved 
down  towards  my  own  house,  which  stands  alone, 
some  two  and  a  half  miles  from  the  town.  In  a 
ruined  fort  a  quarter  of  a  mile  from  my  villa  a 
halt  was  made,  and  messengers  were  despatched 
to  town  with  letters  to  the  British  Minister  to 
release  the  tribal  prisoners,  who  for  the  last  week 
or  so  had  been  comfortably  housed  in  the  basement 
of  the  British  Consulate,  having  been  brought  up 
from  Laraiche  in  specially-chartered  steamers. 
Within  an  hour  we  saw  the  sixteen  prisoners 
arriving,  and  very  shortly  afterwards  they  were 
being  welcomed  by  their  friends.  Lord  Cranley, 
Mr  Wyldbore-Smith,  Mr  Kirby  Green,  and  Mr 
Carleton  accompanied  the  prisoners  on  behalf  of 
the  British  Legation,  but  no  formal  exchange 
took  place.  The  moment  the  prisoners  arrived  I 
was  free  to  depart,  though  the  many  adieux  that 
I  had  to  make  with  my  mountain  friends  took 
some  little  time.  We  parted  on  the  best  of  terms, 
and,  wild  and  savage  as  the  two  hundred  tribesmen 
looked,  I  could  not  but  feel  how  great  a  debt  of 
gratitude  I  owed  them  for  having  released  me  from 
the  dangers  and  discomforts  of  my  first  days  of 
captivity. 

For  a  year  after  this  adventure  R-aisuli  remained 
tolerably  quiet,  but  the  following  spring  he  carried 
out  a  coup  even  more  daring.  He  surrounded  the 
villa  of  Mr  Perdicaris  at  night,  and  carried  off  both 
the  proprietor  and  his  son-in-law.  The  American 
Government  sent  a  fleet  to  Tangier,  and  the  whole 


RAISULI  199 

world  watched  the  ensuing  negotiations.  Mr  Per- 
dicaris  and  Mr  Varley  were  restored  to  liberty  ; 
but  at  what  a  price !  Raisuli  demanded  and 
obtained  from  the  Sultan  the  following  terms. 
That  he  should  be  appointed  the  Governor  of  all 
the  districts  in  the  neighbourhood  of  Tangier ; 
that  the  existing  Governor — his  former  friend,  who 
had  betrayed  him — should  be  deposed ;  a  ransom 
of  $70,000,  the  imprisonment  of  all  his  enemies, 
and  the  release  from  prison  of  all  his  friends — 
and  other  concessions  of  less  importance.  The 
Sultan  surrendered,  and  the  terms  were  carried 
out.  Raisuli  found  himself  all-powerful — a  hero 
in  the  eyes  of  the  Moors,  a  menace  in  those  of 
Europe. 

His  first  acts  were  good.  He  put  down  the 
effervescence  which  Bou  Hamara's  rebellion  had 
caused  in  the  neighbourhood,  and  he  opened  the 
roads  to  caravan  traffic,  and  since  he  was  made 
Governor  not  a  single  caravan  had  been  robbed 
within  the  limits  of  his  jurisdiction.  He  brought 
about,  in  fact,  a  period  of  greater  security  than 
had  existed  during  the  previous  year  or  two — but 
a  security  that  depended  upon  Raisuli  was  natu- 
rally a  doubtful  one. 

As  his  influence  increased  he  became  a  despot. 
He  squeezed  the  people  under  him,  and  extorted 
money  from  even  the  very  poorest  of  the  poor. 
The  Maghzen  lived  in  terror  of  him,  and  let  him 
know  it,  with  the  result  that  he  ignored  their 
orders  and  commands,  and  even  the  treaties  with 
Europe.  He  threatened  and  blackmailed  even  the 


200  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

Maghzen  authorities,  who  openly  acknowledged 
then-  incapacity  to  deal  with  him,  and  he  became 
at  the  same  time  the  protector  and  the  scourge 
of  Tangier  and  the  surrounding  districts.  He 
enforced  his  authority  up  to  the  very  gates  of  the 
town,  and  his  armed  followers  even  entered  and 
dragged  out  of  prison  men  who  were  not  in  his 
jurisdiction.  His  representatives  administered  jus- 
tice (!)  in  the  market-place,  and  beat  people  to  death 
within  a  few  yards  of  the  French  and  German  Lega- 
tions. In  1906  Raisuli  had  reached  the  zenith  of 
his  power.  At  Zinat  it  was  sufficient  to  tell  a  man 
that  he  was  a  prisoner,  and  he  would  never  attempt 
to  escape.  There  was  no  need  to  lock  him  up — he 
knew  that  his  master's  arm  was  long  enough  to 
reach  him  wherever  he  fled  to, — and  the  strange 
sight  of  dozens  of  prisoners  at  liberty  could  be 
seen  there  on  any  day.  Raisuli  showed  all  the 
qualities  required  by  a  strong  Governor  in  Morocco, 
but  unfortunately  he  overdid  it.  For  him  there 
existed  no  treaties.  His  and  his  representatives' 
actions  at  this  period  are  well  known.  The  flog- 
ging of  protected  natives,  the  cutting  off  of  the 
electric  light,  the  blackmailing  of  Europeans,  the 
destruction  of  property — a  long  list  of  acts  of 
unbearable  tyranny. 

At  length  the  representatives  of  the  European 
Powers  could  endure  it  no  longer.  They  addressed 
a  collective  Note  to  the  Moorish  Minister  of 
Foreign  Affairs  at  Fez,  demanding  that  an  end  be 
made  to  the  impossible  state  of  affairs  existing 
in  the  Tangier  districts.  It  was  almost  an  ulti- 


RAISULI  201 

matum,  for  the  bay  was  full  of  the  warships  of 
France  and  Spain,  present  to  protect  European 
interests  until  the  introduction  of  the  new  police. 
The  Sultan  and  his  viziers  could  not  misunderstand 
the  purport  of  this  Note.  The  Minister  of  War 
was  ordered  to  proceed  to  Tangier  with  all  avail- 
able forces. 

Early  in  January  1907  the  troops  that  had 
arrived  from  Fez  were  camped  not  many  miles 
from  Raisuli's  stronghold,  waiting  for  orders  to 
attack.  News  was  brought  to  me  that  this  attack 
would  take  place  two  days  later,  on  Saturday, 
6th  January;  and  it  was  still  dark  when  that 
morning,  at  a  very  early  hour,  I  left  Tangier  on 
horseback  with  three  trusted  Moors  to  see  what  I 
could  of  it.  I  had  clothed  myself  in  the  flowing 
dress  of  a  trooper  of  Moorish  irregular  cavalry,  as 
I  knew  that  orders  had  been  issued  to  prevent 
Europeans  approaching  the  spot,  and  also  so  as 
to  be  able  to  move  about  the  scene  of  action  with- 
out attracting  notice.  Before  we  had  emerged 
into  the  open  country  we  had  passed  no  less  than 
six  outposts  of  some  twenty-five  men  each,  for 
the  Maghzen  authorities  had  been  taking  great 
precautions  to  protect  the  town ;  but  even  the 
clattering  of  our  horses'  shoes  upon  the  paved 
roads  failed  to  wake  a  single  man  from  the  deep 
slumber  in  which  they  were  lying  inside  their 
tents.  At  dawn  we  were  a  good  many  miles  away, 
but  we  had  time  to  spare,  and  rode  slowly, 
realising  that  a  long  day  lay  before  us ;  and  it 
was  seven  o'clock  before,  from  the  point  of  a  low 


202  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

hill,  the  camp  of  the  Shereefian  troops  was  visible 
in  the  plain  below  us.  A  mile  to  our  left  was  the 
famous  hill  of  Zinat,  with  its  rocky  crests  and 
precipices,  and  its  steep  lower  slopes  stretching 
down  to  the  plain,  at  places  dotted  with  olive 
groves.  Set  in  the  midst  of  this  background  stood 
Raisuli's  stronghold,  a  large  rambling  building, 
half-fort,  half-house,  with  windows  dotted  irregu- 
larly about  its  front,  and  here  and  there  a  battle- 
mented  tower  rising  above  the  rest  of  the  roof, 
a  strong  building  in  a  very  strong  position.  Away 
behind  Zinat  and  in  front  of  us  rose  the  higher 
peaks  of  the  Beni  Msaour  Mountains,  range  beyond 
range,  until,  bounding  the  eastern  horizon,  they 
were  overtopped  by  the  snow-clad  summits  of 
Beni  Hassan.  There  were  no  signs  of  the  coming 
struggle  at  that  moment.  Cattle  were  feeding 
near  the  little  villages  on  the  plain,  and  thin 
white  smoke,  hanging  heavily  in  the  bright  air, 
issued  from  the  thatched  roofs  and  tents  of  the 
plains-people  as  they  cooked  their  breakfasts.  In 
the  Shereefian  camp  there  was  some  movement, 
and  near  Raisuli's  stronghold  his  followers  could 
be  seen  strolling  about,  while  the  smoking  chim- 
neys of  his  house  bespoke  the  fact  that  they  too 
were  preparing  their  breakfasts. 

It  was  nine  o'clock  before  the  scene  changed. 
Clear  in  the  still  air  a  bugle  rang  out  in  the  camp. 
They  must  have  heard  it  away  at  Zinat,  for  sud- 
denly from  the  summit  of  the  rocks  above  Raisuli's 
fortress  a  long  thin  column  of  white  smoke  arose, 
then  another  and  another,  and  then  from  peak  to 


RAISULI  203 

peak,  as  far  as  the  eye  could  reach,  the  fires  were 
answered.  The  mountaineers  were  signalling  to 
one  another  that  the  great  battle  was  imminent. 
Down  in  the  camp  below  us  the  infantry  were 
"  falling  in  "  and  the  cavalrymen  mounting  their 
horses,  and  it  was  only  a  few  minutes  later  when 
amongst  the  beating  of  drums  and  the  blowing 
of  bugles,  the  neighing  of  horses  and  the  fluttering 
of  coloured  banners  and  flags,  the  Shereefian 
troops  marched  out  on  to  the  plain.  A  hoarse 
shout  arose  from  every  throat,  "  Ah  !  salih  en- 
Nebi,  Rasoul  Allah ! "  an  invocation  to  the 
Prophet,  repeated  again  and  again,  and  answered 
by  a  far-away  and  fainter  cry  of  the  same  words 
from  the  fortress  and  rocks  of  Zinat. 

Once  all  the  troops  are  out  on  the  plain  they  are 
drawn  up  in  formation  for  the  attack.  On  the  right 
were  the  artillery,  two  field-guns,  and  a  couple  of 
Maxims,  carried  by  mules.  Near  them,  amidst  a 
panoply  of  banners,  rode  the  Commander-in-Chief 
and  his  staff,  a  group  of  a  hundred  or  so  persons 
well  mounted  and  gaily  dressed,  with  their  bright 
saddles  of  every  shade  of  coloured  cloth  and 
silk  adding  to  a  scene  already  brilliantly  pictur- 
esque. In  the  centre  were  some  800  infantry  with 
a  strong  support  of  tribal  cavalry,  while  on  the 
left  a  somewhat  smaller  force  formed  the  flank. 
The  contingent  of  loyal  mountaineers  in  their 
short  black  cloaks  could  be  seen  already  scaling 
some  low  hills  away  on  the  extreme  right.  Then 
slowly  the  whole  army  advances. 

It  was  a  moment  of  thrilling  excitement.     From 


204  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

the  rocky  hill  where  I  had  taken  up  my  point  of 
vantage  the  whole  scene  was  passing  at  my  very 
feet.  On  my  left  the  fortress  and  rocks ;  on  my 
right  the  slowly  advancing  forces — the  left  flank 
within  a  hundred  yards  or  so  of  where  I  stood. 
At  Zinat  there  was  not  a  sign  of  life,  though  with  my 
glasses  I  could  see  the  glint  of  rifle-barrels  in  the  em- 
brasures of  the  house,  and  now  and  then  amongst 
the  precipices  and  rocks  above  it.  The  troops  are 
within  1200  yards  now,  and  in  the  open,  but  still 
advancing  slowly,  for  the  most  part  in  close  forma- 
tion, and  offering  even  at  that  range — a  long  one 
for  the  Moors,  who  are  proverbial  bad  shots — an 
excellent  target.  The  sunlit  air  is  so  still  that 
every  little  sound  rises  unbroken  from  the  plain 
below :  a  word  of  command  here,  a  bugle-call 
there.  Then  suddenly  the  firing  opens  from  Zinat 
— the  quick  nervous  spitting  of  the  Mauser  rifles, — 
rendered  the  more  impressive  from  the  fact  that 
nothing  can  be  seen,  for  there  is  not  a  single  man 
there  who  does  not  use  smokeless  powder.  A  few 
Askaris  are  seen  to  fall,  killed  or  wounded,  and  the 
advance  ceases.  The  whole  army  replies,  firing 
at  an  impossible  range  into  a  solid  fort  and  still 
more  solid  precipice  with  rifles  that  have  only 
reached  Morocco  after  they  have  long  been  dis- 
carded as  useless  in  Europe,  and  with  powder 
that  issues,  evil-looking  and  evil-smelling,  from 
the  barrels  of  their  weapons.  After  all,  it  made 
little  difference  where  they  fired,  for  few  or  none 
had  ever  handled  a  rifle  before,  and  there  was 
nothing  to  shoot  at.  Meanwhile  the  cavalry 


RAISULI  205 

galloped  to  and  fro  in  every  direction,  except  to 
advance,  waving  flags  and  firing  their  rifles,  appa- 
rently at  the  green  plover  that  swept  over  in 
flocks,  disturbed  by  the  unusual  racket. 

Inane  impotent  warfare,  carried  on  by  undis- 
ciplined and  uncourageous  men,  whose  uniforms 
alone  bespoke  them  as  soldiers. 

A  curl  of  thin  yellow  smoke,  widening  as  it 
ascended,  rises  from  the  rocks  far  above  the  house 
— the  first  shell  fired  by  the  artillery,  followed  by 
another  and  another,  which,  although  aimed  at 
the  house  itself,  fall  in  widely  different  directions, 
more  than  once  nearer  the  Maghzen  troops  than 
the  enemy.  During  the  entire  action  of  this 
Saturday,  although  the  range  was  only  about 
1000  metres,  the  house  was  only  struck  twice, 
and  even  the  explosion  of  these  two  shells  did  not 
force  the  defenders  to  abandon  the  flat  roof  and 
windows,  though  they  cannot  have  failed  to  be 
effective.  Meanwhile  the  troops  on  the  left,  under 
the  cover  of  the  rocks,  had  entered  and  burned  a 
village  out  of  Raisuli's  line  of  fire,  and  were  return- 
ing toward  the  camp  laden  with  loot,  under  the 
impression  that  their  duty  for  the  day  was  over. 
Nor  did  any  one  attempt  to  persuade  them  to 
re-enter  the  fight,  and  I  watched  them  disappear, 
staggering  under  huge  mattresses,  chests  of  painted 
wood — the  dowry  of  every  Moorish  bride, — and  a 
thousand  other  household  articles.  For  a  back- 
ground— the  burning  village,  the  flames  of  which 
rose  lurid  and  roaring  into  the  still  air,  to  pass 
away  in  great  rolls  of  heavy  white  smoke. 


206  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

From  one  to  two  o'clock  the  firing  slackened, 
but  at  the  latter  hour  another  attempt  was  made 
to  advance.  The  whole  line  pushed  forward,  but 
700  or  800  yards  from  Zinat  they  broke,  and — 
well,  if  they  did  not  exactly  run,  they  certainly 
returned  very  quickly.  It  was  at  this  moment 
that  two  picturesque  incidents  occurred.  From 
Raisuli's  house  emerged  a  woman,  who,  crossing 
the  open  ground  under  a  heavy  fire,  mounted  upon 
a  rock  and  thence  cursed  the  troops.  She  threw 
back  her  thick  "  haik,"  and,  tearing  her  hair, 
waved  her  arms  towards  heaven,  but  the  firing 
drowned  her  voice.  Then  slowly  and  majestically 
she  drew  her  veil  around  her  and  retired.  A  few 
seconds  later  eight  men,  no  doubt  encouraged  by 
her  bravery,  rushed  into  the  open  grounds,  shout- 
ing and  jeering  at  the  retiring  forces,  and  firing 
the  while  with  their  Mausers.  It  was  then  that 
the  Commander-in-Chief  fell  wounded  in  the  neck. 
A  mule  was  brought,  and,  supported  by  his  ret- 
inue, he  was  hurriedly  taken  back  to  the  camp. 
By  this  time  the  army  had  used  up  all  their  shells 
and  nearly  all  their  cartridges.  Even  a  reserve 
force,  hidden  in  a  river-bed  a  mile  in  the  rear, 
had  been  firing  at  that  range  at  the  mountain 
ever  since  the  morning,  to  the  imminent  danger 
of  their  advancing  comrades. 

The  army  was  now  retiring  in  good  order,  fol- 
lowed by  Raisuli's  eight  men,  who  every  now  and 
then  sped  a  parting  shot  at  them.  The  battle 
at  Zinat  was  over.  The  great  effort  of  the  Maghzen 
had  failed,  and  the  stronghold  and  village,  except 


RAISULI  207 

for  a  few  holes  made  by  the  shells,  stood  as  placid 
and  peaceful  in  appearance  as  it  had  been  in  the 
morning.  The  great  Shereefian  army  had  proved 
itself  to  be — like  everything  else  in  Morocco, 
except  perhaps  Raisuli  himself — a  gigantic  bluff. 

It  was  well  on  in  the  afternoon  now,  and  the 
scene  of  the  fight  was  deserted.  I  crept  up  a  little 
gully  to  within  400  or  500  yards  of  the  house,  and, 
peeping  from  between  the  rocks,  I  took  a  long 
view  with  my  glasses.  On  the  green  sward  in 
front  of  the  house  stood  a  man  holding  a  pair  of 
glasses  to  his  eyes.  On  either  side  of  him  were 
a  few  retainers.  He  stood  silent  and  still,  watching 
the  retreating  army.  It  was  Raisuli. 

At  dawn  on  Sunday  morning  I  was  back  again 
in  the  hills  near  Zinat.  Never  did  the  sun  rise 
over  a  more  peaceful  scene  or  one  more  serenely 
beautiful.  Peak  after  peak,  many  touched  with 
snow,  turned  pink  and  gold  as  the  first  rays  of  the 
rising  sun  touched  their  summits.  At  Zinat  itself 
all  was  quiet.  A  little  blue  smoke,  the  smoke  of 
wood  fire,  arose  from  the  chimneys  of  Raisuli' s 
house,  in  front  of  which  half  a  dozen  mountaineers 
were  warming  themselves  over  a  small  bonfire. 

It  was  nine  o'clock  before  the  troops  left  the 
camp,  and,  deploying  in  much  the  same  formation 
as  the  day  before,  advanced  across  the  plain. 
But  their  numbers  were  increased,  for  reinforce- 
ments had  been  hurriedly  sent  by  night  from 
Tangier,  and  fresh  contingents  of  loyal  moun- 
taineers had  turned  up  in  force.  But  what  was 
still  more  important  was  the  addition  of  one  man, 


208  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

an  Algerian  artillery  officer  attached  to  the  Sultan's 
service  by  the  French  Government,  whose  shooting 
with  the  field-guns  at  Taza  and  Oujda  had  largely 
saved  the  situation  at  both  places.  It  had  been 
the  intention  of  the  Maghzen  to  send  him  on 
Saturday,  but  owing  to  his  being  a  French  subject 
they  decided  not  to  do  so,  as  in  their  own  con- 
sideration any  one  to  do  with  France  was  at  this 
period  a  person  to  be  avoided.  Their  folly  lost 
them  the  day.  Had  Si  Abderrahman  ben  Sedira 
been  behind  the  guns  on  Saturday,  Raisuli's  house, 
and  probably  Raisuli  and  most  of  his  followers, 
would  have  been  destroyed.  The  proof,  if  one 
were  needed,  is  this.  He  accomplished  more 
destruction  with  the  two  shells  he  fired  at  the 
fortress  on  Sunday  morning  than  in  the  130  shots 
fired  on  Saturday.  A  general  advance  toward 
Zinat  was  commenced  a  little  before  two,  and  the 
two  shells  above  mentioned  were  fired  from  the 
field-guns.  There  was  no  reply  from  the  house 
or  from  the  rocks  above  it.  Already  the  troops 
were  considerably  nearer  than  they  had  ever  got 
the  previous  day.  A  little  hesitation  was  visible, 
for  no  doubt  the  soldiers  imagined  that  they  were 
being  allowed  to  approach  to  within  an  easy  and 
certain  range.  The  left  were  well  ahead,  led  by 
Raisuli's  late  Calipha,  more  royalist  than  the 
King  nowadays,  who  was  followed  close  by  his 
contingent  of  the  Fahs  tribe.  Three  hundred 
yards  only  now  separated  them  from  the  village. 
With  a  wild  shout  and  a  volley  from  then*  rifles 
the  cavalry  charged.  Over  the  rising  ground  they 


RAISULI  209 

passed,  a  brilliant  flash  of  colour,  and  never  drew 
rein  till  they  were  at  Raisuli's  door. 

The  house  and  village  were  empty.  Then  began 
a  scene  of  pandemonium.  Askaris,  horsemen, 
and  tribal  contingents  rushed  upon  the  castle, 
and  the  wildest  looting  commenced.  Other  bands, 
intent  upon  pillage,  ransacked  the  neighbouring 
houses.  In  a  few  minutes  flames  burst  forth 
from  the  thatched  roofs  of  the  surrounding  huts. 
The  flames  spread,  and  in  as  short  a  space  of  time 
as  it  takes  to  write  it  the  whole  village  was  ablaze. 
The  strong  wind  drove  the  heavy  smoke  in  huge 
clouds  across  the  face  of  the  mountain,  and  in 
half  an  hour  all  that  was  left  of  Zinat  were  the 
burning  houses  from  above  which  Raisuli's  for- 
tress towered,  as  yet  but  slightly  damaged.  Then 
smoke  burst  out  from  its  windows.  The  roof, 
already  half  blown  off  by  the  shells,  fell  with  a 
crash ;  a  wall  toppled  over  in  clouds  of  dust,  and 
little  by  little  the  stronghold  became  a  useless 
ruin.  Not  a  shot  was  fired  from  the  mountain, 
for  there  was  no  one  to  fire  one.  Silently  in  the 
night  Raisuli  and  his  followers,  and  the  inhabitants 
of  the  neighbouring  villages,  with  all  their  old 
people,  their  women  and  children,  and  their  flocks 
and  herds,  had  crept  away  into  the  darkness  over 
the  plain  and  on  into  the  mountains.  Not  a  guard 
had  been  posted  to  keep  watch,  not  a  blow  had  been 
struck  to  prevent  them  escaping.  Under  the  rocks 
upon  which  I  was  seated  the  soldiers,  laden  with 
loot,  were  returning.  Carpets,  mattresses,  boxes, 
vases  of  artificial  flowers,  tea-trays  and  tea-cups, 

o 


210  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

sacks  of  flour  and  grain,  rolls  of  matting — all  the 
belongings  and  appurtenances  of  Moorish  houses 
formed  their  burdens.  One  soldier,  a  cheery 
kindly-looking  giant,  was  whistling  to  a  canary  in 
a  cage,  which  he  had  brought  away  in  preference 
to  more  valuable  loot. 

As  I  rode  over  the  brow  of  the  hill  on  my  way 
back  to  Tangier  I  drew  rein  for  a  moment  and 
looked  back.  The  army  was  leaving  Zinat,  and 
the  burning  houses  were  little  more  than  heaps 
of  smouldering  ashes.  Beyond  lay  the  high  moun- 
tains of  Beni  Msaour,  whence  Raisuli  and  the 
inhabitants  of  his  villages  must  have  been  looking 
upon  the  ruins  of  their  homes. 


II. 


RAISULI  was  now  completely  outlawed.  He  lived 
in  the  fastness  of  his  mountains,  where  the  Sultan's 
troops  could  never  even  attempt  to  penetrate. 
Thence  he  spread  alarm  right  and  left,  causing 
constant  fears  and  panics,  even  to  the  Europeans 
at  Tangier. 

The  whole  situation  in  Morocco  was  seething. 
The  tribes  had  become  to  all  intents  and  purposes 
independent,  and  many  threw  off  all  pretence  of 
obeying  the  orders  of  their  Governors  or  of  paying 
taxes.  Such  as  were  more  vulnerable,  either  from 
their  geographical  position  or  by  their  numerical 
weakness,  were  persecuted  and  squeezed  to  make 
up  for  the  delinquencies  of  the  others.  The 
rapacity  of  the  viziers  was  greater  than  ever,  and 
the  Sultan's  extravagances  seemed  to  have  in- 
creased by  the  fresh  supply  of  money  that  an  ill- 
advised  foreign  loan  had  a  year  or  two  before 
brought  into  his  spending  power.  Bou  Hamara, 
the  Pretender,  in  the  Rif,  and  Raisuli  amongst 
the  mountain  tribes,  were  the  two  principal  thorns 
in  the  Maghzen's  side.  With  Bou  Hamara,  who 
stated  that  he  was  the  eldest  brother  of  the  Sultan, 
nothing  could  be  done.  He  remained  in  the 


212  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

inaccessible  Rif  tribe-lands,  where  he  governed  as 
a  petty  Sultan ;  and  even  the  Spanish  authorities, 
who  waited  long  to  see  him  driven  out,  were  at 
last  obliged  to  enter  into  relation  with  him,  in 
order  to  ensure  the  security  of  their  "Presidios." 
That  Bou  Hamara  and  Raisuli  were  in  com- 
munication is  certain,  but  there  was  little  respect 
and  little  confidence  between  them,  and  except 
for  the  passage  of  letters  no  compact  of  real  or 
practical  importance  seems  to  have  existed  between 
them.  Yet  that  their  relations  were  cordial  is 
clear,  from  the  original  document  in  my  possession 
sealed  by  Bou  Hamara  with  his  great  seal  of  State, 
by  which  he  appoints  Raisuli  Governor  of  certain 
of  the  mountain  tribes.  On  this  seal  of  State, 
Bou  Hamara  uses  the  style  "  Mohammed  ben 
Hassen  " — claiming  thereby  to  be  Mulai  Moham- 
med, the  eldest  son  of  Mulai  Hassen,  and  therefore 
the  elder  brother  of  the  reigning  Sultan. 

Raisuli  had  no  pretensions  to  the  Sultanate, 
though  in  the  eyes  of  Europe  he  played  a  more 
important  part,  for  his  principal  activities  were 
employed  in  the  districts  of  Tangier,  the  diplo- 
matic capital  of  the  country. 

In  1906  that  futile  Conference  of  Algeciras — 
futile,  that  is  to  say,  in  so  far  as  it  had  any  bene- 
ficial effect  in  Morocco — had  met,  discussed,  signed, 
and  separated.  It  had  for  Europe,  no  doubt, 
cleared  the  situation,  and  was  a  check  to  Germany ; 
but  poor  Morocco  gained  little — in  fact,  it  marked 
one  more  step  on  its  road  to  ruin.  Never  probably 
did  such  a  collection  of  diplomatists,  whose  high- 


RAISULI  213 

sounding  titles  fill  the  first  few  pages  of  that 
insignificant  little  yellow -book  which  contains 
the  results  of  their  insignificant  labours,  give 
themselves  airs  of  such  importance.  For  days 
together  they  discussed  the  questions  of  the  import 
of  sporting-guns  and  the  rifling  of  gun-barrels  with 
all  the  pomposity  of  affairs  of  the  gravest  moment 
— to  pass  to  the  rules  for  the  distribution  of  parcels 
post.  Three  or  four  men  were  playing  a  great 
stake — representatives  of  England  and  France, 
and  of  Germany — and  it  was  well  played.  The 
victory  remained  with  the  two  former.  The  rest 
were  puppets,  but  didn't  realise  it.  They  really 
thought,  or  seemed  to  think,  that  their  endeavours 
were  being  of  service  to  the  country  which  few 
of  them  knew  anything  about,  beyond  the  distant 
view  they  could  obtain  of  it  from  the  hills  above 
Algeciras. 

Northern  Morocco  was  at  its  worst  the  year  after 
the  Algeciras  Act  had  been  signed,  and  even  the 
pleasure-loving  Mulai  Abdul  Aziz  perceived  that 
affairs  were  becoming  serious.  He  decided  to 
open  negotiations  with  Raisuli.  For  this  purpose 
Kaid  Maclean  had  an  interview  with  the  brigand 
chief  in  April  (1907).  Raisuli  listened  to  the 
Raid's  proposals,  but  refused  to  accompany  him 
to  Fez,  where  the  Sultan  was  then  residing. 
However,  a  step  had  been  made  toward  a  possible 
arrangement.  A  month  later,  armed  with  the 
authority  of  the  Sultan,  Kaid  Maclean  returned 
to  Alcazar,  a  town  on  the  Tangier-Fez  road, 
situated  about  sixty  miles  from  the  former.  But 


214  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

meanwhile  it  has  leaked  out  that  Raisuli  would 
attempt  the  capture  of  this  important  functionary. 
Every  effort  was  made  by  the  Sultan,  who  had 
also  received  the  news,  and  by  the  British  Legation, 
to  cancel  the  interview,  and  the  British  Consular 
Agent  at  Alcazar  was  instructed  to  this  effect  to 
continue  the  negotiations.  An  interview  with 
Raisuli  was  secretly  arranged,  to  be  held  on  the 
borders  of  the  Ahlserif  tribe-lands,  some  few  miles 
from  Alcazar.  There  these  two  personages  met. 
The  Sultan's  propositions  were  made  known  to 
Raisuli,  who  pretended  to  accept  them,  and  to 
be  disposed  to  return  to  Fez  with  the  Kaid.  He 
would,  he  said,  start  at  once,  and  if  the  Kaid  would 
accompany  him  to  the  village  where  his  camp 
was  pitched  they  would  set  out  the  next  day. 
The  Kaid  agreed,  and  entered  the  mountains  with 
his  host — only  there  was  no  setting  out  the  next 
day,  for  he  found  himself  a  prisoner,  and  remained 
in  captivity  for  some  seven  months,  suffering 
considerable  hardships. 

Of  all  the  negotiations  for  the  obtaining  of  the 
liberty  of  Raisuli' s  prisoners,  these  were  the  most 
difficult.  The  terms  demanded  by  Raisuli  were 
preposterous,  and  a  score  of  people  seemed  negotiat- 
ing on  their  own  account,  while  the  Kaid  himself 
was  doing  his  utmost,  and  very  naturally,  to  obtain 
his  release.  The  result  was  confusion  and  mis- 
understanding, and  the  distance  from  Tangier  at 
which  Raisuli  kept  his  captive  increased  the 
difficulties.  Had  the  whole  affair  been  left  in  the 
hands  of  Sir  Gerard  Lowther,  who  at  this  period 


RAISULI  215 

ably  represented  England  in  Morocco,  it  is  probable 
that  Kaid  Maclean's  release  would  have  been  more 
quickly  obtained.  But  on  every  occasion  on  which 
a  solution  seemed  near  some  perfectly  new  pro- 
position, emanating  from  unauthorised  sources, 
would  frustrate  the  official  plans.  In  the  end 
Raisuli  obtained  £20,000,  and  he  was  made  a 
British  protected  subject ;  and  there  were  other 
minor  terms.  Kaid  Maclean  was  released.  The 
only  pleasing  aspect  of  all  these  brigandage  cases 
was  the  absolute  confidence  that  Raisuli  always 
placed  in  the  word  of  the  British  Government, 
the  British  authorities,  and  in  fact  that  of  all 
Britishers. 

Some  years  after  this  event,  when  the  ex-Sultan 
Mulai  Abdul, Aziz,  who  had  just  abdicated,  was  visit- 
ing my  villa  at  Tangier,  I  showed  him  two  Arabic 
documents.  One  was  his  original  "  Dahir "  for 
the  nomination  of  Raisuli  as  Governor  of  the 
tribes,  which  the  brigand  had  extorted  as  part  of 
the  ransom  of  Perdicaris ;  and  the  other  was 
Raisuli' s  appointment  as  Governor  of  the  same 
tribes,  bearing  another  great  seal  of  State,  that 
of  the  Pretender,  Bou  Hamara.  Mulai  Abdul 
Aziz  asked  me  how  I  had  become  possessed  of 
these  two  documents.  I  told  him.  The  "  Dahir  " 
of  the  Pretender  I  had  found,  during  my  im- 
prisonment, in  a  secret  cupboard  in  a  room  of 
Raisuli's  house  at  Zinat.  I  had  carried  it,  sewn 
up  in  my  clothing,  with  other  equally  interesting 
correspondence,  during  the  whole  period  of  my 
captivity.  The  firman  of  the  Sultan  himself  I 


216  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

had  obtained  the  day  Raisuli's  house  was  looted 
by  the  Maghzen  troops,  at  which  picturesque 
incident  I  had  been  present. 

The  ex-Sultan  smiled.  "  There  seems,"  he  said 
rather  cynically,  "to  be  nothing  of  interest  in 
Morocco  which  hasn't  reached  either  your  know- 
ledge or  your  hands  ;  nothing  that  you  haven't 
had  given  you — acquired  ?  " 

"  The  most  valuable  of  all  things  was  given  me," 
I  replied. 

"  And  that  was  ?  " 
X"  Your  Majesty's  friendship." 

It  was  at  this  period,  while  an  outlaw  in  the 
mountains,  that  Raisuli  nearly  made  his  most 
important  capture.  It  was  an  incident  that  was 
kept  very  quiet  at  the  time,  but  leaked  out  in 
the  French  Press  a  little  later.  The  truth  was,  we 
Europeans  who  played  a  part — and  we  very 
nearly  played  a  very  serious  part — in  the  story 
had  no  desire  for  publicity. 

The  facts  were  these.  The  ruins  of  Raisuli's 
stronghold  at  Zinat  were  only  distant  from  Tangier 
about  fourteen  miles,  and  formed  a  tempting 
excursion,  but  one  which  no  one  undertook,  as 
it  was  notoriously  unsafe.  However,  as  time  went 
on  and  nothing  occurred  in  the  neighbourhood  of 
Tangier  to  disturb  the  tranquillity,  and  as  Raisuli 
and  his  band  seemed  permanently  to  have  taken 
up  their  residence  in  the  mountains  at  a  con- 
siderable distance  from  the  scene  of  their  former 
activities,  a  picnic  at  Zinat  was  decided  upon, 
and  I  was  invited.  The  other  members  of  our 


RAISULI  217 

party  consisted  of  Sir  Gerard  Lowther,  then 
British  Minister  to  Morocco,  Monsieur  and  Madame 
de  Beaumarchais  of  the  French  Legation,  and 
Mr  Christopher  Lowther,  the  son  of  the  Speaker 
of  the  House  of  Commons.  I  formed  the  fifth 
member  of  the  party. 

One  hot  summer  morning  we  rode  out,  having 
sent  our  lunch  on  in  advance.  On  nearing  Zinat 
we  were  hailed  by  a  countryman  who  was  plough- 
ing his  fields.  I  rode  to  see  what  he  wanted, 
and  was  informed  that  Raisuli's  band  was  back 
at  Zinat,  apparently  having  come  to  take  away 
some  treasure  which  had,  by  being  buried,  escaped 
the  looting  of  the  soldiery  at  the  time  of  the  destruc- 
tion of  the  castle.  He  advised  us  not  to  proceed. 
We  discussed  this  news,  and  in  the  folly  of  an 
enjoyable  excursion,  decided,  as  the  lunch  was  on 
ahead,  to  proceed.  Nothing  could  surpass  the 
tranquillity  of  the  scene  on  our  arrival,  and  we 
were  soon  lunching  under  the  shade  of  the  olive- 
trees.  I  confess  that  the  pleasure  of  the  foie-gras 
was  mingled,  in  my  case,  with  a  certain  nervous 
apprehension  from  which  the  others  appeared 
immune.  We  did  not  believe,  or  had  pretended 
not  to  believe,  the  story  of  the  return  of  Raisuli's 
brigands. 

Lunch  was  nearly  over  when  the  glint  of  a  rifle- 
barrel  in  the  thick  brushwood  caught  my  eye, 
and  another  and  yet  another  in  the  rocks,  for  the 
hill  at  Zinat  is  a  wild  precipitous  slope  of  broken 
masses  of  rock  and  scrub.  A  minute  later  we  were 
surrounded.  The  men  were  perfectly  polite,  and 


218  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

to  all  intents  and  purposes  appeared  merely  to 
have  come  to  wish  us  good- day.  At  their  head 
was  the  good-looking  young  Ahmed  el-Aoufi, 
Raisuli's  second-in-command,  a  personal  friend  of 
my  own,  who  had  shown  me  considerable  kindness 
during  my  captivity  with  the  brigands  in  1903. 
He  shook  us  warmly  by  the  hand,  and,  his  rifle 
between  his  knees,  sat  down  to  spend  the  time 
of  day.  A  few  yards  away,  in  a  complete  circle 
round  us,  were  thirty  or  forty  of  his  men. 

I  confess  that  situations  like  this  exhilarate  me. 
I  hate  bloodshed  and  noisy  encounters,  but  a 
delicate  situation  has  a  zest  that  is  unique,  and, 
heavens  !  it  was  a  delicate  situation.  The  British 
Minister  and  the  French  Charge  d' Affaires — what 
a  coup !  I  was  the  only  member  of  the  party  who 
spoke  Arabic,  and  the  suspense  the  others  must 
have  suffered  during  the  next  hour  or  two  must 
have  been  extreme.  Yet  no  one  made  a  sign. 
I  have  often  seen  great  examples  of  self-restraint, 
but  never,  I  think,  greater  than  on  this  occasion. 
Remember,  my  friends  understood  nothing  of 
what  I  was  saying,  except  that  every  now  and 
again  I  referred  to  them  for  confirmation  of  my 
assertions.  For  me  the  situation  was  very  exciting. 
If  I  was  taken  after  all,  it  was  only  what  had 
happened  before,  and  I  was  used  to  adventure  and 
hardship — but  for  the  others  !  and  I  could  not 
help  thinking  of  the  terms — probably  impossible 
terms — that  Raisuli  would  demand  for  their  re- 
lease— and  of  the  possible  consequences  !  I  have 
found  on  occasions  like  these — for  this  was  by 


RAISULI  219 

no  means  the  only  tight  place  of  the  kind  that 
I  have  been  in — that  not  only  is  there  a  kind 
of  exhilaration,  but  also  that  one's  power  of 
concentration  of  thought  is  accentuated.  How- 
ever inauspicious  the  actual  surroundings  may  be, 
one  feels  and  knows  that  the  mental  superiority 
rests  with  the  European,  and  that  hereditary 
training  of  thought  and  education  stand  one  in 
good  stead.  The  Moor  is  no  fool,  he  is  cunning 
and  astute,  but  his  mind  is  untrained — and  he  is 
confiding  when  dealing  with  Europeans.  In  the 
first  moments  of  our  encounter  at  Zinat  I  knew 
that  our  safety  depended  upon  the  game  that  I 
was  determined  to  play — and  which  I  played 
successfully. 

I  began  with  an  enormous  untruth.  Holding 
El-Aoufi's  hand,  I  told  him  I  was  delighted  to 
see  him,  and  that  his  visit  was  most  opportune 
— nothing,  in  fact,  could  have  been  better.  Then 
I  sat  him  down,  and  talked  to  him  and  to  his  chief 
companions  seriously.  It  was  at  this  moment 
that  Madame  de  Beaumarchais,  with  the  admir- 
able sangfroid  of  a  talented  and  courageous 
Frenchwoman,  took  a  photograph.  The  man  to 
whom  I  was  talking  was  Ould  el-Aoufi  ;  the  Euro- 
pean seated  just  behind  me  was  the  late  Sir 
Gerard  Lowther. 

The  story  that  I  told  them  was  this.  I  reminded 
them  that  Raisuli  had  been  driven  from  the 
Governorship  of  Tangier  and  the  surrounding 
tribes  at  the  demand  of  the  European  Powers. 
They  had  acted  unwisely  and  realised  it,  and  now 


220  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

they  regretted  their  action.  "  Do  you  know,"  I 
asked,  "  who  these  people  are  who  are  here 
to-day  ?  " 

"  We  are  not  sure,"  they  replied. 

"  Then  I  will  teU  you,"  and  I  did.  Instead  of, 
as  would  seem  natural,  trying  to  conceal  the 
identity  of  my  distinguished  friends,  I  launched 
out  into  exaggerated  statements  as  to  their  im- 
portance. I  saw  I  had  made  an  impression.  My 
audience  were  now  thoroughly  puzzled. 

"  And  why  are  they  here  ?  "  I  asked.  "  Listen, 
and  I  will  tell  you.  The  Powers  of  Europe  regret 
Raisuli's  departure  and  disgrace.  They  desire 
him  to  be  reinstated,  but  the  Sultan  has  refused. 
The  Powers  insist,  and  as  the  Maghzen  still  holds 
out,  the  Governments  of  England  and  France  have 
telegraphed  to  their  representatives — the  gentle- 
men you  see  here  to-day — instructing  them  to 
visit  the  scene  of  the  depredations  on  Raisuli's 
castle,  and  to  make  all  the  necessary  arrangements 
for  its  reconstruction  as  quickly  as  possible,  so 
that  Raisuli  can  be  restored  to  his  own,  and  once 
more  introduce  law  and  order  into  the  region. 
For  this  purpose  we  are  come  to-day — against  the 
advice  of  all  our  friends — so  that  the  work  can 
be  undertaken  at  once.  Meanwhile  the  letter 
recalling  Raisuli  from  the  mountains  is  being 
drawn  up."  I  then  added,  "  We  were  warned 
on  the  way  that  we  should  find  you  here,  and 
advised  to  turn  back,  but  I  told  the  people  who 
warned  us  that  Raisuli's  men  would  perfectly 
understand  our  mission,  and  nice  trouble  they

would  get  into  with  their  chief  if  they  captured 
the  very  men  who  are  insisting  on  restoring  him 
to  his  former  grandeur,  and  obtaining  the  return 
of  all  his  confiscated  property — and  even  rebuild- 
ing his  castle  at  the  expense  of  the  Governments  ^ 
they  represent.  "  I  should  like  to  see  your  face,  -^n^ 
friend  Ahmed  el-Aoufi,  after  Raisuli  had  discovered 
the  '  gaffe '  that  you  had  made ;  and  if  I  know 
your  chief,  friend  and  confidant  as  you  are,  I  can 
imagine  the  stripes  he  could  lay  upon  your  bare 
back.  Do  you  think  that,  unless  we  had  been 
really  his  benefactors,  we  should  ever  have  been 
such  fools  to  have  ventured  into  this  hornets' 
nest  ?  Now  up  with  you,"  I  cried,  rising,  "  and 
we  will  see  what  we  can  do  with  these  ruins." 

I  led  the  way  down  to  the  ruins,  and  for  the 
next  hour  measured  walls,  took  notes  of  the  local 
price  of  masons  and  carpenters  and  the  possibilities 
of  obtaining  bricks  on  the  spot,  proposed  a  new 
water-supply  which  the  laws  of  gravitation  ren- 
dered quite  impossible,  and  even  whispered  in 
El-Aoufi's  ear  that  there  would  be  money  to 
build  him  a  little  house  adjoining  his  chief's. 
We  came  to  the  conclusion  that  for  between 
£12,000  and  £15,000,  taking  into  consideration 
that  Raisuli  could  obtain  a  plentiful  supply  of 
forced  labour,  and  as  much  material  as  he  liked, 
the  house  could  be  restored  to  more  than  its 
pristine  glories. 

Another  photograph  taken  by  Madame  de  Beau- 
marchais  pictures  us  pacing  out  the  length  of  the 
walls  of  the  house. 


222  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

My  note-book  full  of  figures,  I  sat  down  again 
and  dictated  to  El-Aoufi  the  following  letter,  which 
he  wrote :  "To  the  trusted  and  well-beloved 
Shereef ,  the  learned  Mulai  Ahmed  er-Raisuli,  peace 
and  the  mercy  of  God  be  upon  you ;  and  acting  on 
the  instructions  of  their  Governments,  of  which 
the  letter  I  sent  you  yesterday  will  have  given 
you  full  particulars,  the  British  Minister  and  the 
French  Charge  d' Affaires  have  paid  a  visit  to  the 
ruins  of  your  Kasbah.  They  have  grieved  much  to 
see  its  piteous  state.  As  you  will  have  learned  by 
the  contents  of  my  letter,  it  is  the  intention  of 
their  Governments  not  only  to  restore  you  to 
power  but  also  to  reconstruct  your  castle.  To-day 
we  are  at  Zinat,  and  we  had  the  good  fortune  to 
find  your  faithful  and  intelligent  deputy,  my  lord 
Ahmed  el-Aoufi,  and  your  followers,  who  have 
been  of  great  use  to  us,  and  have  shown  us  many 
things  that  have  helped  us,  and  have  guarded  us 
in  security  and  peace  from  any  bad  people  who 
may  have  been  about.  We  are  grateful.  And  my 
lord  Ahmed  el-Aoufi  will  tell  you  of  many  things 
which  in  our  friendship  for  you  we  have  confided 
to  him.  We  will  await  at  Tangier  a  reply  to  the 
letter  I  sent  you  yesterday,  explaining  fully  those 
things,  and  immediately  on  receiving  the  reply 
measures  will  be  taken  to  commence  the  restora- 
tion of  your  Kasbah ;  but  it  is  trusted  that  you 
will  not  wait  its  completion  before  returning  to 
your  former  position,  for  any  delay  will  only 
protract  the  unsatisfactory  state  of  affairs  existing 
at  present,  and  continue  the  nervousness  of  the 


RAISULI  223 

population  of  Tangier  and  the  oppression  of  the 
poor  country  people.  My  lord  El-Aoufi  will  tell 
you  all.  May  peace  be  with  you." 

To  this  epistle  I  put  my  signature,  and  not  one 
pang  of  conscience  did  I  feel,  nor  have  felt  since. 
Raisuli  and  I  had  played  many  games — only  this 
one  was  a  little  bigger  than  the  rest.  To  tell  the 
truth,  so  far  from  feeling  guilty,  I  literally  revelled 
in  my  deception. 

It  was  time  to  return  to  Tangier,  and  I  confess 
I  was  nervous.  I  proposed  to  El-Aoufi  that  the 
others  should  start  first,  and  that  I  should  remain 
for  a  while  and  catch  them  up  on  the  road.  I 
wanted  to  spend,  I  said,  a  little  while  longer  in 
his  company — it  was  a  pleasure  so  rare  and  so 
valued. 

With  a  sigh  of  relief  I  saw  the  rest  of  our  party 
mount.  El-Aoufi  shook  hands  with  all  of  them 
and  thanked  them  for  their  visit — and  they  rode 
slowly  away.  My  fears  were  at  an  end. 

I  sat  for  half  an  hour,  and  explained  to  El-Aoufi 
that  Raisuli  would  have  already  received  my 
(perfectly  imaginary)  letter  of  yesterday  which 
explained  the  whole  situation,  and  that  on  his 
return  to  his  chief  in  the  mountains,  some  six  or 
eight  hours'  journey  farther  on,  he  would  find 
him  fully  informed.  He  (El-Aoufi)  must,  I  added, 
have  crossed  my  letter  en  route.  Had  he  not  met 
the  messenger,  whose  name  I  gave  ?  No  !  Well, 
then,  he  must  have  taken  another  track.  My 
friends  were  now  no  more  than  little  black  specks 
far  away  in  the  plain.  I  rose  and  embraced  El- 


224  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

Aoufi,  and  in  the  manner  of  the  country  we  kissed 
each  other's  shoulders.  My  horse  was  brought, 
and,  cantering  slowly  down  the  slope,  I  rode  away 
toward  Tangier. 

In  spite  of  the  deliberate  series  of  falsehoods 
of  which  I  had  been  guilty  during  those  few  hours, 
I  never  felt  less  conscience-stricken — and  perhaps 
never  happier — in  my  life. 

I  have  seen  Raisuli  many  times  since  the  inci- 
dent. He  referred  to  El- Aoufi,  after  a  trial  fight, 
as  a  lion  of  courage. 

"  There  was  no  finer  creature  in  God's  world," 
I  replied,  "  than  the  lion,  but  sometimes  the  wily 
jackal  deceives  him." 

I  noticed  a  little  flash  in  Raisuli' s  eye,  but  he 
answered  languidly,  "  Verily  the  jackal  is  an 
unclean  beast." 

Sir  Gerard  Lowther,  the  Beaumarchais,  Christo- 
pher Lowther,  and  I  all  dined  together  the  night 
of  our  adventure,  but  we  didn't  talk  very  much 
about  it.  Our  thankfulness  for  our  escape  was 
only  equalled  by  our  appreciation  of  our  immense 
folly  in  having  undertaken  the  expedition.  We 
agreed  that,  if  possible,  the  incident  was  to  be 
kept  a  secret,  but  a  few  weeks  later  the  '  Temps ' 
contained  the  whole  story,  which  had  leaked  out 
from  native  sources  and  got  to  Paris. 

I  should  have  liked  to  have  seen  the  interview 
of  Raisuli  and  El- Aoufi  when  the  latter  related 
the  incident  and  gave  him  my  letter.  He  fell 
from  favour  for  a  time,  as  might  be  expected, 
but  he  came  to  see  me  in  Tangier  a  few  months 


RAISULI  225 

later.  We  did  not  mention  the  visit  to  Zinat, 
but  discussed  more  general  subjects.  Talking  of 
the  good  and  bad  qualities  of  mankind,  El-Aoufi 
said,  "  The  most  degrading  thing  in  the  world  is 
deceit,"  and  he  said  it  quite  nastily. 

"  In  my  opinion  there  is  something  even  more 
humiliating,"  I  replied. 

"  That  is  ? " 

"  To  be  made  a  fool  of." 

But  we  parted  the  best  of  friends. 


III. 


ALTHOUGH,  as  will  have  been  appreciated,  my 
relations  with  Raisuli  were  varied  and  adventure- 
some, I  bear  him  no  grudge ;  and  I  think  he  always 
considered  me  as  a  friend,  and  I  hope  does  so  now. 
He  has,  on  his  visits  to  Tangier,  often  spent  hours 
at  a  time  in  my  house,  discussing  the  many  situa- 
tions in  the  country  and  the  varying  attitudes  of 
the  mountain  tribes.  He  had  lost  much  of  his 
former  handsome  appearance,  having  become  heavy 
and  stout,  and  his  expression  perhaps  more  cruel. 
He  was  always  courteous  and  generally  amusing, 
often  in  a  very  sarcastic  cynical  manner.  He  was 
full  of  his  own  importance,  and  seemed  to  realise 
that  he  was  unique — which,  perhaps  happily,  he 
certainly  was. 

On  one  occasion  while  at  my  house,  he  saw  in  a 
glass  case  an  illuminated  Koran  of  considerable 
artistic  value,  both  on  account  of  its  antiquity 
and  of  its  beauty.  Now,  the  Moors  cannot  bear 
to  see  their  religious  books  in  the  possession  of 
Europeans,  and  Raisuli,  without  more  ado,  ex- 
tracted the  book  from  the  vitrine,  kissed  it  rever- 
ently, carefully  wrapped  it  in  a  silk  handkerchief, 
and  placed  it  in  the  hands  of  one  of  his  slaves. 


RAISULI  227 

He  gave  no  explanation  of  his  action,  which,  after 
all,  needed  no  explanation.  The  conversation 
flowed  on  in  other  channels,  and  he  never  so  much 
as  mentioned  the  book.  A  little  later  he  left — and 
so  did  my  Koran. 

I  had  two  of  these  Korans,  but  the  one  which 
Raisuli  had  taken  was  much  the  finest,  from  the 
collector's  point  of  view.  The  second  copy  was, 
however,  newer  and  more  brilliant  in  colour,  and 
certainly  would  appear  in  the  eyes  of  a  Moor  a 
more  desirable  acquisition,  for  to  them  antiquity 
is  of  no  great  account.  This  second  copy  Raisuli 
had  not  seen. 

The  next  day  I  sent  one  of  my  Moors  with  it, 
wrapped  in  silk,  to  ask  Raisuli  whether  he  would 
be  willing  to  restore  me  the  one  he  had  taken  in 
exchange  for  this  newer  and  far  better  preserved 
volume.  The  first  copy,  I  informed  him,  perhaps 
not  quite  truly,  had  a  very  great  personal  interest 
to  me,  and  I  begged  him  to  accept  the  second 
and  restore  me  the  older  one.  I  hinted  that  the 
second  was  a  much  superior  book.  My  man 
returned  crestfallen  and  sad.  His  mission  had 
failed.  He  brought  me  many  friendly  messages 
from  Raisuli  but  no  book,  neither  the  first  nor  the 
second,  for  Raisuli  had  kept  both.  It  was  ex-/ 
asperating,  but  there  was  nothing  to  be  done  but 
to  swear  to  be  equal  with  him  at  some  future 
time. 

One  morning,  about  a  month  later,  I  sent  to 
him  asking  him  to  lend  me  two  riding-mules  with 
their  saddles,  for  some  friends  of  mine  to  ride  on 


228  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

to  a  picnic — good  pacing  mules,  as  my  friends 
were  not  accustomed  to  riding.  Half  an  hour 
later  two  very  fine  mules,  caparisoned  in  rich  red 
saddles,  arrived,  led  by  Raisuli's  slaves.  I  myself 
put  them  in  my  stable  and  turned  the  key.  I 
then  sent  to  Raisuli  to  say  that  when  I  had  my 
books  he  could  have  his  mules.  One  of  his  secre- 
taries returned  with  my  messenger,  and  after  the 
usual  compliments  informed  me  that  his  master 
had  instructed  him  to  say  that  the  books  were 
invaluable,  and  that  he  could  not  restore  them. 
The  mules  were  mine,  he  added ;  in  fact  every- 
thing Raisuli  possessed  was  mine — except,  of 
course,  the  books — and  if  I  required  more  mules 
or  horses  he  could  send  me  as  many  as  I  wished. 
He  could  easily  have  done  so  :  he  possessed  dozens 
and  dozens,  if  not  hundreds,  nearly  all  confiscated 
or  extorted  from  the  people  of  the  country.  They 
had  cost  him  nothing  to  get,  then  they  would 
therefore  cost  little  to  give. 

My  conscience  smote  me.  My  little  trick  ap- 
peared so  mean  beside  this  dignified  magnificence 
and  generosity  of  Raisuli.  I  offered  to  restore  the 
mules,  but  he  would  not  hear  of  it.  They  continued 
in  my  stables,  and  my  friendship  with  their  former 
owner  flowed  on  undiminished  and  unchanged.  I 
saw  him  often.  Since  the  episode  of  the  Koran, 
books  have  never  been  mentioned  between  us ; 
now  mules  were  also  placed  upon  the  Index. 
Never  directly  or  indirectly  in  his  conversations 
did  we  ever  refer  to  the  subject.  Nor  was  my 
capture  ever  spoken  of.  Only  once  a  tactless 


RAISULI  229 

European  broached  in  the  brigand  chief's  presence 
of  my  having  been  for  some  time  at  his  stronghold 
at  Zinat.  With  a  pleasant  smile  Raisuli  interposed  : 
"  My  house  is  always  at  the  disposal  of  my  friends." 
Hospitality  is  innate  in  the  Moorish  character. 

The  giving  and  taking  of  presents  was  practised 
a  great  deal  in  the  "  old  "  Morocco,  but  it  is  now 
happily  disappearing.  It  was  always  a  great 
nuisance.  One  often  gave  away  something  one 
really  wanted — and  it  was  so  difficult  to  replace 
anything — and  got  in  return  some  perfectly  useless 
acquisition.  I  have  arrived  back  in  Tangier  after 
a  long  journey  in  the  interior  with  half  a  dozen 
new  horses,  most  of  them  neither  good  nor  bad. 
I  couldn't  possibly  ride  them  all,  and  they  were 
only  a  very  irksome  expense  and  luxury.  At 
first,  and  for  a  long  time,  I  hesitated  to  adopt  the 
custom  of  the  country,  and  hand  them  on  as 
presents  to  some  one  else.  A  feeling  possessed  me 
that  gifts  were  "  sacrosanct,"  and  must  be  kept 
at  all  costs,  and  that  the  giver  would  be  hurt  in 
his  feelings  to  learn  that  his  present  had  been 
passed  on.  But  in  time  I  found  that  the  donor 
didn't  care  the  least  what  became  of  his  presents, 
or  ever  give  them  a  second  thought. 

One  of  the  viziers  once  gave  me  an  amber  neck- 
lace of  transparent  cut  beads.  He  said  the  Sultan 
had  given  it  to  him,  and  that  His  Majesty  had 
received  it  from  a  high  official  from  the  southern 
capital.  A  few  years  afterwards  I  gave  it  to  a 
young  European  lady  about  to  be  married,  as  a 
wedding  present,  to  find  out  that  it  had  been  her

father  who  had  brought  it  to  Morocco — as  looking 
much  more  expensive  than  it  really  was — and  had 
given  it  to  one  of  the  tribal  Governors  in  return 
for  something  else.  It  had  travelled  all  over 
Morocco,  but  got  home  at  last  to  where  it  had 
started  from,  to  meet  with  no  appreciation.  We 
laughed  over  the  history  of  the  necklace,  and  the 
damsel  got  another  present  in  exchange.  My 
amber  beads  now  deck  the  fair  throat — if  she  ever 
wears  them — of  a  beautiful  and  distinguished  lady 
far  away  from  Morocco. 

My  stables  were  often  full  to  overflowing,  and 
were  a  very  great  strain  upon  my  resources,  until 
I  steeled  my  heart  and  gave  the  horses  away  as 
they  came  in.  But  unfortunately  it  was  not 
horses  the  Moorish  authorities  wanted :  they  had 
already  too  many.  No,  it  was  one's  watch  or 
one's  shot-gun,  or  a  sporting-rifle,  or  a  barometer 
or  field-glasses  that  they  always  set  their  hearts 
upon — something  rare  and  impossible  to  procure 
or  replace  in  the  country.  Nor  were  one's  troubles 
over  when  the  exchange  of  presents  was  accom- 
plished, for  there  were  the  numberless  tips  that 
had  to  be  given.  A  horse  would  be  brought,  led 
by  a  slave  and  accompanied  by  the  chief  of  the 
stables  and  two  grooms — and  they  had  to  be 
satisfied.  Then  probably  the  son  of  the  donor 
would  pay  a  visit  to  my  camp  and  express  a  sudden 
and  intense  desire  to  be  possessed  of  my  shot-gun 
or  my  watch-chain  ;  and  when  he  had  left,  satisfied 
perhaps  with  a  less  costly  present  from  a  box  of 
objects  brought  for  the  purpose,  the  secretary  of 


RAISULI  231 

his  father  would  arrive  to  apologise  for  the  son's 
rudeness,  and  to  say  that  he  would  be  punished 
by  his  father  for  having  ventured  to  ask  for  any- 
thing. He  would  sing  the  praises  of  my  recently- 
acquired  horse.  Then  a  tone  of  sadness  would 
be  adopted.  He  was  a  poor  man ;  he  had  had 
troubles.  He  wouldn't  have  breathed  of  it  to 
another,  not  if  lions'  teeth  were  tearing  his  entrails  ; 
but  he  felt  that  the  bond  of  sympathy  between  us 
was  so  close  that — and  then  came  out  a  long  story, 
perfectly  untrue  of  course,  of  the  meanness  of  his 
employer,  and  of  his  unpaid  salary,  &c.  He  could 
keep  his  secret  no  longer,  he  must  tell  it,  and  with 
tears  in  his  eyes  he  would  beg  for  a  sum  of  money, 
generally  modest  enough.  However,  there  was 
always  scope  for  bargaining,  and  his  demands 
would  diminish,  till  eventually  he  would  go  away 
with  a  few  coins  in  ecstasy  of  pretended  gratitude. 
Accepting  the  hospitality  of  the  great  chiefs 
was  only  a  little  less  costly,  and  a  night's  enter- 
tainment by  some  dignitary  or  governor  of  a  tribe 
was  often  both  tiring  and  expensive.  It  meant  a 
succession  of  visits  to  one's  camp  on  the  part  of  a 
host  of  inquisitive  people,  most  of  whom  wanted 
something.  There  were  the  guards  too,  who  were 
specially  given  one  to  keep  away  these  inquisitive 
people,  but  who,  in  fact,  only  added  to  their 
number.  These  guards  expected  payment  for  the 
duties  they  so  signally  failed  in  accomplishing. 
Then  great  quantities  of  food  were  sent  by  the  high 
official — living  fowls,  a  live  sheep,  loaves  of  sugar, 
packets  of  tea,  barley  for  the  horses,  and  these 


232  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

commodities,  supplied  in  abundance  that  was  as 
extravagant  as  it  was  irksome,  necessitated  un- 
ending tips  in  exchange.  It  took  three  men,  for 
instance,  to  lead  the  sheep,  and  a  slave  to  carry 
each  fowl — and  one  and  all  waited  their  pourboires 
before  departing.  Then  at  dinner-time — generally 
it  was  so  late  that  it  was  nearly  midnight — great 
dishes  of  cooked  food  would  arrive — and  very 
excellent  they  were — and  probably  the  great  man 
himself  and  some  of  his  household  would  invite 
themselves  to  the  dinner  they  had  so  amply  pro- 
vided. It  was  nearly  always  very  tiring,  and  always 
very  late  before  sleep  could  be  obtained.  Once  in 
a  way  it  was  pleasant  enough,  and  I  can  look  back 
upon  many  and  many  a  night  spent  in  this  way 
in  feasting  with  the  great  men  of  the  land,  the 
memory  of  which  is  very  pleasant.  No  food  was 
wasted,  for  the  sheep  and  chickens  were  killed 
and  the  retainers  and  slaves  came  and  helped  in 
the  camp-kitchen,  and  brought  great  earthen  pots 
and  pans  for  the  cooking — and  sat  and  sang  and 
ate  the  whole  night  through.  On  the  outskirts 
of  the  camp  would  collect  the  poor,  and  these 
were  never  forgotten. 

I  have  travelled  in  China  and  Japan,  in  Persia, 
Arabia,  and  Abyssinia,  and  in  many  parts  of 
North  Africa,  Turkey  in  Asia  and  Syria,  but 
"  old  "  Morocco  was  by  far  the  most  expensive 
to  travel  in.  There  were  absolutely  no  facilities 
— no  caravanserais  to  put  up  in,  and  all  food  and 
sometimes  fodder  and  fuel  had  to  be  carried  with 
one.  Nothing  but  a  sheep  and  chickens  could  be

RAISULI  233 

bought  on  the  road,  even  one's  bread  had  to  be 
transported  or  cooked  in  camp.  The  purchase  or 
hire  of  caravan  animals  was  always  heavy,  and 
sometimes  exorbitant.  Tips  were  excessive.  Only 
at  the  towns  at  long  distances  apart  could  any 
stores  be  replenished,  and  in  the  inland  cities, 
beyond  tea,  sugar,  and  candles,  nothing  else  was 
procurable.  In  spring-time  butter  could  be  bought, 
but  even  if  it  was  procurable  at  other  periods  of 
the  year  it  was  always  the  preserved  "  smin " 
with  its  strong  taste  and  smell.  I  have  never  yet 
discovered  the  reason  that  rendered  travel  so 
difficult  and  so  expensive.  The  bad  Government 
no  doubt  had  much  to  do  with  it,  for  there  was 
actually  not  only  no  incentive  to  the  people  to  pros- 
per and  breed  animals,  but  on  the  contrary  to  be 
rich  or  even  fairly  well-to-do  rendered  the  native 
liable  to  arrest,  confiscation  of  his  property,  and 
perhaps  total  disappearance.  Yet  the  Moor  has 
been  always  thrifty,  ready  to  turn  his  hand  to 
work,  and  still  more  ready  to  earn  money.  In 
spite  of  this,  it  was  often  difficult  even  in  the  big 
centres  to  collect  caravan  mules  for  a  journey,  and 
then  hire  was  often  exorbitant. 

I  am  writing  of  journeys  in  which  I  travelled 
as  a  European  with  a  large  camp,  often  alone, 
sometimes  in  the  company  of  friends,  when  all 
the  rigid  etiquette  and  formality  of  visits  to  the 
Kaids  and  local  authorities  had  to  be  paid.  But 
there  were  other  journeys  when,  with  half  a  dozen 
mules  of  my  own,  and  my  own  men  with  me,  a 
few  good  horses,  and  tents  of  less  pretensions  and 


234  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

native  in  character,  I  wandered  through  the 
country  alone  and  in  native  clothes,  for  months 
and  months  together.  Those  were  the  great  days : 
long  almost  objectless  journeys,  wandering  whither 
the  desire  led  me — now  to  the  cities  of  Wazzan, 
Fez,  or  Marrakesh,  now  on  the  borders  of  the 
snows  of  the  Great  Atlas.  Unless  actually  explor- 
ing, as  on  my  Tafilet  journey,  I  never,  of  course, 
pretended  to  pass  as  a  native ;  but  the  fact  of  the 
Moorish  dress  kept  away  the  inquisitive  people, 
and  even  reduced  the  constant  demands  that  were 
made  upon  one's  purse.  It  rendered  life  much 
more  pleasant.  Instead  of  pitching  one's  camp 
outside  the  great  men's  castles,  I  was  invited  to 
stay  within,  generally  in  a  little  guest  apartment 
of  two  or  three  rooms,  and  the  masses  of  un- 
necessary food  were  reduced  to  pleasant  meals 
with  one's  host.  To  the  Moor  "  Christian  "  clothes 
and  a  hat  on  one's  head  meant  the  most  formal 
of  relations,  while  once  these  were  discarded  I 
was  accepted  in  intimacy. 

The  latest  visit  that  I  have  paid  to  Raisuli  was 
about  eight  years  ago,  when  he  was  building  his 
palace  at  Arzeila.  I  was  accompanied  by  a  young 
niece,  who  had  come  on  a  short  visit  to  Tangier, 
and  by  a  girl  friend  of  hers.  I  thought  nothing 
could  be  more  amusing  for  two  English  girls  than 
to  pay  a  visit  to  the  famous  brigand  at  the  little 
old  walled  town  of  Arzeila,  with  the  remains  of 
its  old  Portuguese  castle  and  bastions.  A  zest 
was  added  to  this  visit  by  the  disapproval  it 
occasioned  amongst  my  friends.  It  was  late  at 


RAISULI  235 

night  when  we  reached  Raisuli's  camp,  for  he  had 
come  some  way  to  meet  us.  A  tidal  river  had 
delayed  us,  and  we  had  sat  on  its  banks  waiting 
for  the  water  to  descend,  until  after  dark.  It 
was  with  a  sigh  of  relief  that  I  saw  the  lights  and 
fires  of  the  camp,  for  the  night  was  pitch  dark, 
and  our  horses — stallions,  of  course,  for  no  one 
rides  anything  else  in  Morocco — had  become  very 
excited  from  the  proximity  of  numerous  mares, 
invisible  in  the  blackness  of  the  night. 

We  found  Raisuli  in  his  great  tent,  a  circular 
canvas  pavilion  some  twenty-five  feet  in  diameter, 
with  high  walls  and  a  lofty  roof.  An  immense 
square  pillar,  rather  than  a  pole,  supported  the 
great  weight,  for  the  whole  tent  was  lined  through- 
out with  heavy  and  very  expensive  dark-green 
cloth.  The  outside  of  the  tent  was  of  white 
canvas  decorated  in  designs  of  indigo  blue  material, 
appliqued  to  the  canvas. 

While  our  tents  were  being  pitched  we  dined  in 
Raisuli's  pavilion.  The  famous  brigand  was  accom- 
panied by  a  certain  number  of  his  friends  and 
secretaries,  while  an  ex-high  native  official  had 
also  arrived  on  a  visit  the  same  day,  to  take  part 
in  the  hunting  we  were  to  be  offered.  My  niece, 
her  friend,  and  myself  were,  of  course,  the  only 
Europeans.  Tall  highly-polished  brass  candle- 
sticks, bearing  large  candles,  stood  on  trays  of  the 
same  material,  and  sufficed  to  light  the  tent  and 
to  illumine  the  faces  of  the  guards  of  mountaineers 
and  the  black  slaves  who  stood  or  squatted  in 
groups  without  the  door,  ready  to  do  their  master's 


236  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

bidding.  A  number  of  smaller  tents  were  pitched 
in  a  great  semicircle,  of  which  the  apex  was 
formed  by  Raisuli's  pavilion. 

Seated  on  luxurious  mattresses,  which  were 
arranged  all  round  the  walls  of  the  great  tent, 
we  were  served  with  dishes  of  cooked  meats, 
green  tea,  with  its  flavouring  mint  and  herbs,  and 
coffee. 

The  following  day  we  rode  on  to  Arzeila. 
Raisuli's  retinue,  a  couple  of  hundred  of  moun- 
taineers, spread  themselves  out  in  a  long  line  and 
hunted  as  they  went,  with  horse  and  gun  and  grey- 
hound, and  sticks  and  even  stones — singing  and 
shouting  the  whole  time. 

On  our  arrival  we  were  invited  by  our  host 
either  to  take  up  our  residence  in  a  house  in  the 
little  town  which  had  been  furnished  and  pre- 
pared for  us,  or  in  a  vast  camp  that  had  been 
pitched  for  our  reception  near  the  sea-shore,  and 
within  two  hundred  yards  of  the  Atlantic  breakers. 
We  chose  the  latter,  for  the  outskirts  of  Arzeila 
form  one  of  the  most  delightful  camping-grounds 
in  Morocco. 

On  our  left  lay  the  old  town,  with  its  frowning 
towers  and  battlements  rising  above  the  olive-  and 
orange-trees  of  the  surrounding  gardens.  In  front 
the  soft  green  grass  sloped  gently  to  the  yellow 
sands  and  the  great  expanse  of  ocean,  while  behind 
us  rose  undulating  grassy  hills.  The  camp  buzzed 
with  life :  soldiers  in  uniform,  slaves  and  servants 
passed  and  repassed,  and  a  long  line  of  some 
forty  horses,  tethered  by  their  feet  in  the  custom 


RAISULI  237 

of  the  country,  were  at  our  disposal  should  we 
want  to  ride  other  horses  than  our  own.  Food, 
dead  and  alive,  poured  into  the  camp — it  seemed 
one  perpetual  procession  of  great  cooked  dishes 
and  flocks  of  sheep  and  crates  of  chickens  and 
pigeons.  A  native  band  discoursed  shrill  music 
at  all  the  most  inconvenient  hours  of  day  and 
night. 

Raisuli  was  the  best  of  hosts,  and  in  excellent 
spirits.  Amongst  other  entertainments  that  he 
offered  us  was  a  luncheon  to  my  niece,  her  friend, 
and  myself,  served  in  an  upper  room  on  one  of 
the  high  towers  that  overhung  the  sea.  With  the 
sweetest  of  smiles,  and  in  a  most  successful  en- 
deavour to  interest  his  young  lady  guests,  if  not 
to  amuse  them,  he  pointed  out  one  of  the  windows 
of  the  room — an  old  embrasure  in  the  walls — 
through  which  at  the  point  of  the  bayonet  he  and 
his  men  had  driven  the  late  Governor  of  the  town, 
the  Kaid  Khalkhali,  to  fall  forty  feet  on  to  the 
rocks  beneath,  only  a  short  time  before.  The  past 
history  of  one's  hosts  at  Moorish  entertainments 
added  a  piquant  flavour  to  the  repasts.  In 
Morocco  one  mustn't  be  too  critical,  and  it  was 
seldom  one  dined  with  any  great  native  authority 
in  the  country  who  had  not  a  record  behind  him 
that  would  have  outdone  Newgate's  historic  annals. 
Thank  God,  those  days  are  over.  The  advent  of 
the  French  has  put  an  end  to  the  period  that  was 
really  terrible.  Yet  when  one  lived  amongst  these  ^ 
great  crimes — the  sudden  appearances  and  dis- 
appearances, the  midnight  burials  in  desert  places, 


238  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

the  carrying  off  of  women;  hate,  love,  revenge, 
and  now  and  again  some  great  unselfishness — the 
exaggeration,  in  fact,  of  all  qualities  and  all  senti- 
ments good  and  bad, — one  ceased  to  wonder. 
Whole  families  would  fall — in  wealth  and  luxury 
to-day,  and  gone  to-morrow — to  rise  again  perhaps 
a  generation  later,  and  carry  on  the  blood-feud  of 
revenge  and  hate — or  perhaps,  generally  unwisely, 
to  forgive. 


IV. 


As  has  already  been  stated,  one  of  the  terms  for 
the  release  of  Kaid  Maclean  demanded  by  Eaisuli 
and  complied  with  by  the  British  Government 
was  his  being  made  a  British  protected  subject, 
which  status  put  him  outside  the  jurisdiction  of 
the  Sultan,  and  rendered  him  amenable  to  British 
law.  It  was  a  humiliating  sacrifice  for  His  Majesty's 
Government  to  have  to  make,  but  there  was  no 
way  out  of  it.  Raisuli  might  have  perhaps  been 
persuaded  to  abandon  the  £20,000  that  he  received 
in  cash,  but  never  this  other  clause  of  the  terms. 
Freed  thus  from  fear  of  arrest  by  the  Sultan,  he  took 
to  a  more  regular  life,  and  began  the  construction 
of  his  great  residence  at  Arzeila.  It  must  be 
added,  that  pending  the  period  during  which  he 
enjoyed  British  protection  he  committed  no  crimes 
that  we  know  of  more  than  those  of  extortion  from 
the  tribes — and  no  doubt  certain  cruelties.  It 
was  fortunate  that  the  suffering  tribesmen  did 
not  complain  to  the  British  authorities,  as  it  would 
have  been  difficult  even  to  summon  Raisuli  to 
appear  in  the  Tangier  Consular  Court — and  still 
more  difficult  to  have  got  him  there. 

While  Raisuli  was  living  quietly  at  Arzeila,  if 


240  MOROCCO  THAT   WAS 

being  visited  by  all  the  neighbouring  tribesmen 
and  living  in  a  turmoil  of  building  can  be  so 
described,  affairs  elsewhere  in  Morocco  were  seeth- 
ing. In  1908  Mulai  Abdul  Aziz,  defeated  with  his 
army  in  the  south,  abdicated,  and  Mulai  Hafid 
seized  the  throne.  After  a  long  and  dangerous 
journey  the  new  Sultan  installed  himself  at  Fez. 
Raisuli  felt  that  his  chance  had  come.  He 
had  helped  in  the  overthrow  of  Mulai  Abdul  Aziz, 
and  had  been  one  of  the  first  to  proclaim  Mulai 
Hafid  in  the  north ;  and,  ambitious  by  nature,  he 
wished  once  more  to  play  a  part,  and  a  great  one, 
in  the  new  regime.  Secret  negotiations  were 
opened  between  him  and  Mulai  Hafid,  which  ended 
in  a  visit  to  the  Court  at  Fez.  The  tussle  that 
ensued  was  most  interesting.  I  was  in  Fez,  and 
in  constant  touch  with  both  the  parties  interested, 
during  the  negotiations.  Of  the  two,  Mulai  Hafid 
was  the  shrewdest.  He  had  more  patience  and 
more  cunning  than  Raisuli,  though  he  too  was 
by  no  means  lacking  in  this  latter  useful  oriental 
characteristic.  The  brigand  chief  had  come  to 
Fez  full  of  the  importance  of  his  power  and  influ- 
ence, but  he  did  not  realise  that  at  the  educated 
and  civilised  Court  he  was  looked  upon  as  little 
more  than  a  very  successful  robber,  who  neverthe- 
less was  recognised  as  a  danger  and  a  thorn  in  the 
Sultan's  side.  His  reception  by  Mulai  Hafid  was 
not  cordial,  in  fact  he  was  kept  waiting  for  some 
time  before  he  could  obtain  an  audience.  The 
viziers  were  polite — and  barely  that.  Raisuli, 
installed  in  a  very  palatial  residence  in  the  city, 


RAISULI  241 

was  bored.  He  longed  to  get  back  to  the  north, 
where  he  reigned  supreme,  and  to  be  quit  of  Fez, 
where  he  was  suspicious  of  lurking  danger,  and 
considered  as  a  person  of  no  great  consequence. 
But  Mulai  Hafid  purposely  let  the  negotiations 
drag  on,  and  Raisuli  had  great  difficulty  in  obtain- 
ing audiences  of  his  Sovereign — and  even  when 
arranged  they  were  continually  postponed.  At 
last,  weary  of  so  much  delay,  he  began  to 
act,  and  to  Mulai  Hafid' s  annoyance,  affairs  in 
the  northern  tribes  began  to  go  badly.  There 
were  rumours  of  a  likelihood  of  Mulai  Abdul  Aziz 
being  proclaimed  again,  and  the  tribes  were  getting 
out  of  hand.  Raisuli  was  the  only  man  who  could 
exert  real  influence  in  those  regions,  and  both  the 
Sultan  and  he  knew  it.  I  was  consulted  by  both, 
and  as  the  peace  of  the  country  was  more  import- 
ant than  these  local  quarrels  in  Fez,  I  strongly 
advised  both  to  come  to  terms.  They  did.  Raisuli 
was  appointed  Governor  over  practically  all  the 
tribes  of  North- West  Morocco,  with  the  exception 
of  Tangier  and  its  surrounding  district ;  but 
before  receiving  this  appointment  he  was  forced 
to  abandon  his  British  protection,  for  by  the  law 
of  the  land  no  "  protected  subject "  could  hold  a 
Maghzen  appointment.  He  was  also  called  upon 
to  refund  the  £20,000  which  the  British  Govern- 
ment had  paid  him  for  Kaid  Maclean's  release. 

So  far  Mulai  Hafid  had  scored,  for  the  British 
Government  was  pressing  him,  as  Sultan,  for  the 
repayment  of  Maclean's  ransom,  which  had  been 
advanced  to  the  impecunious  Maghzen,  unable  to 

Q 


242  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

raise  the  sum.  At  the  same  time,  in  abandoning 
his  British  protection,  Raisuli  became  amenable 
once  more  to  Moorish  law  and  jurisdiction;  and 
Mulai  Hafid,  who  hoped  to  be  able  to  consolidate 
his  sovereignty  in  the  north,  foresaw  the  possi- 
bilities of  being  able  some  day  to  rid  himself  of 
this  chieftain  if  he  became  too  troublesome. 
Raisuli,  on  the  contrary,  knew  that  within  a  few 
months  he  could  easily  repay  himself  the  £20,000 
out  of  the  tribes  he  was  now  appointed  to  govern, 
and  he  was  sufficiently  sure  of  his  own  influence 
and  power  to  fear  no  possible  reprisals  on  the  part 
of  the  Sultan.  He  promised  devoted  loyalty,  but 
had  already  determined  on  absolute  independence. 
Having  satisfied  the  Sultan  and  given  considerable 
presents  in  money  to  the  viziers,  he  left  Fez  for 
the  north — and  has  never  returned  to  the  capital 
since. 

It  must  be  acknowledged  that  during  the  four 
years  that  Raisuli  was  Governor  of  these  northern 
tribes  he  maintained  order  in  the  region.  The 
roads  were  open  to  caravan  traffic,  and  robberies 
were  rare.  But  it  was  a  government  of  terror 
and  extortion.  His  prestige  was  enormous,  and 
he  exerted  it  to  its  full.  The  tribes  brought 
everything  that  he  demanded — and  he  demanded 
much.  Money  poured  into  his  coffers ;  labour 
they  supplied  free.  Caravans  of  lime  and  building 
material  came  in  endless  array  to  Arzeila,  and 
the  great  house  rose  tier  above  tier  over  the  sea- 
walls of  the  town.  He  built  residences,  too,  at 
Zinat  and  at  Tazerout,  in  the  Beni  Aros  tribe. 


RAISULI  243 

His  stables  were  filled  with  horses  and  mules,  for 
which  he  paid  little  or  nothing.  He  entertained 
hospitably — in  fact,  kept  open  house,  as  is  the 
custom  of  the  country.  But  behind  all  was  the 
cruel  iron  will  and  the  heavy  hand,  and  thousands 
who  might  have  been  free  obeyed  him  as  if  hypno- 
tised, and  brought  their  little  all  to  him,  generally 
to  be  told  to  go  back  and  bring  more.  Half  revered, 
half  feared ;  a  little  loved  and  perhaps  entirely 
unhated — for  no  one  dared  to  hate  him, — Raisuli 
ruled  the  tribes  of  North- West  Morocco,  and  treated 
them  as  slaves.  His  principal  enemy  at  this  time 
was  the  Kaid  er-Remiki,  who  had  offered  his  ser- 
vices to  Spain,  and  had  organised  the  pretended 
attack  on  Alcazar,  which  gave  the  Spaniards  the 
excuse  for  occupying  that  town  in  1911.  Remiki 
was  a  German  agent,  even  in  those  days,  and  he 
and  his  family's  actions  had  long  been  suspect. 
His  relations  with  Raisuli  were  strained,  for  the 
mountain  brigand  saw  in  this  leader  of  the  plains 
— for  Remiki  was  Kaid  of  the  Khlot  tribe — a  pos- 
sible rival.  His  presence,  too,  with  the  Spaniards, 
and  the  aid  he  was  openly  giving  them,  drove 
Raisuli  still  further  into  a  spirit  of  independence 
and  opposition ;  but  as  time  went  on  and  the 
Spanish  troops  occupied  the  plains  round  Alcazar, 
Raisuli  saw  his  position — or  at  least  his  property 
— threatened,  for  he  owns  very  considerable  estates 
in  those  regions.  Spanish  attempts  at  opening 
negotiations  with  him  failed  for  a  considerable 
time,  but  at  last  a  modus  vivendi  was  arrived  at, 
which  at  first  seemed  successful.  A  permanent 


244  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

understanding  between  Raisuli  and  the  Spanish 
authorities  was,  however,  more  than  could  be 
hoped  for — both  were  overwhelmed  by  an  exag- 
gerated sense  ^fjirrcrmr  pwpraf  and  neither  under- 
stood, nor  desired  to  understand,  the  mentality 
of  the  other.  Raisuli  was  ready  to  be  friendly  so 
long  as  his  independence  was  not  interfered  with ; 
the  Spaniards  were  also  prepared  to  be  friendly  so 
long  as  Raisuli  did  not  exert  this  very  independence 
that  he  claimed  and  insisted  upon.  The  result  was 
constant  friction.  Nor  was  the  situation  rendered 
easier  by  the  fact  that  the  methods  being  adopted 
by  the  Spanish  civil  authorities  were  completely 
at  variance  with  those  of  the  military  chiefs,  for 
neither  consulted^  the  other.  A  good  deal  of  the 
correspondence  which  passed  between  the  Spaniards 
and  Raisuli  at  this  date  came  into  my  hands.  It 
is  of  no  very  particular  interest  except  in  showing 
the  totally  opposed  objects  and  ends  of  the  Spanish 
military  and  civil  authorities.  Things  even  went 
so  far  that  measures  were  taken  by  certain  military 
authorities  to  bring  about  the  "  disappearance  " 
of  Raisuli.  The  accident  was  to  have  taken  place 
while  he  was  en  route  to  pay  a  visit  to  the  Spanish 
civil  authorities  at  Tangier  with  the  idea  of  arrang- 
ing a  visit  to  Madrid.  The  Spanish  Legation  at 
Tangier  was,  of  course,  completely  ignorant  of  this 
plot,  and  had  given  a  safe-conduct  to  Raisuli. 
It  only  reached  the  ears  of  the  Spanish  Charge 
d' Affaires  at  almost  the  last  moment.  There  was 
just  time  to  send  a  native  runner  to  Raisuli  to 
warn  him  not  to  start  on  this  journey,  which 


RAISULI  245 

would  certainly  not  have  passed  without  a  pro- 
bably fatal  incident.  The  Spanish  authorities  at 
Tangier  behaved,  as  might  have  been  expected, 
with  great  promptitude  and  correctness.  The  fact 
was  that  the  jealousy  existing  between  the  Spanish 
military  authorities  .at  Laraiche  and  the  Spanish 
representative  at  Tangier  was  such  that  neither 
knew  what  the  other  was  doing  or  proposing  to 
do.  While  General  Silvestre,  who  commanded  the 
Spanish  troops  at  Laraiche,  was  pursuing  an 
energetic  policy,  and  foresaw,  rightly,  the  diffi- 
culties that  Raisuli's  presence  and  attitude  would 
cause  Spain  in  the  future,  the  Spanish  Legation  at 
Tangier  was,  on  the  contrary,  in  favour  of  making 
terms  with  the  brigand,  and  using  him  in  further- 
ance of  Spanish  aims  and  ambitions.  Either  pol- 
icy, if  skilfully  applied,  would  probably  have  been 
successful,  but  both  put  into  action  at  the  same 
moment  did  not  tend  to  allay  Raisuli's  suspicions. 
Eventually  he  came  to  Tangier,  where  at  least  this 
time  his  life  was  safe  ;  and  while  he  was  actually 
negotiating  with  Madrid,  the  military  authorities 
at  Laraiche,  exasperated  by  the  difficulties  put 
in  their  way  ^_jiis_intrigues,  confiscated  his 
properties  and  broke  off  all  relations  with  him. 

Raisuli  was  once  more  an  outlaw,  and  took  to 
the  mountains.  His  one  object — his  one  desire — 
became  to  make  the  Spaniards  restore  his  property 
and  to  have  revenge.  It  was  not  long  before  his 
schemes  took  form,  and  the  Spanish  troops  and 
military  "  posts "  received  no  rest.  There  was 
constant  murder,  and  constant  theft  and  "  sniping," 


246  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

and  attacks  and  alarms  at  night.  Civilians,  too, 
suffered,  for  any  and  every  Spaniard  was  an  object 
of  Raisuli's  wrath  and  vengeance. 

The  brigand's  attitude  with  regard  to  Spaniards 
had  never  been  a  secret.  He  may  have  cordially 
disliked  subjects  of  the  other  Powers  of  Europe, 
but  the  inhabitants  of  the  Peninsula  he  despised. 
During  the  latter  period  of  his  outlawry,  when  he 
was  threatened  with  attack  by  the  Sultan's  troops, 
he  had  ordered  his  followers  to  "  capture  a  Chris- 
tian "  as  a  hostage.  It  was  no  easy  matter,  for 
precaution  had  been  taken  at  Tangier ;  but  one 
day  a  band  of  his  men  chanced  upon  a  little 
caravan  of  Spanish  workmen  en  route  from  Tetuan 
to  Tangier.  They  were  promptly  seized,  and  a 
messenger  was  hurriedly  sent  to  Raisuli  to  announce 
that  some  "  Christians  "  had  been  taken.  The 
brigand  chief  was  at  this  moment  in  the  Beni 
Msaour  Mountains,  and  thither  the  captives  were 
despatched.  When  he  saw  them  he  waxed  exceed- 
ing wroth,  and  turning  to  his  men,  he  shouted, 
"  I  ordered  you  to  capture  me  '  Christians '  and  you 
bringjne  Spaniards  " — and  promptly  let  them  go. 
He  knew  by  experience  that  the  terms  he  could 
extract  from  Spain  for  the  ransom  of  half  a  dozen 
jjoor  Spaniards  would  be  small  indeed.  In  a 
former  case  in  which  two  Spaniards,  a  boy  and  a 
girl,  had  been  captured  from  Arzeila,  they  had  both 
been  killed  by  the  brigands  owing  to  the  unfortu- 
nate manner  in  which  the  negotiations  had  been 
opened  by  the  authorities.  In  later  years,  however, 
since  the  occupation  of  Tetuan  by  the  Spaniards, 


RAISULI  247 

the  mountain  tribes  have  engaged  profitably  in 
local  brigandage.  They  know  the  exact  value  of  a 
Spanish  soldier  or  non-commissioned  officer,  and 
a  Spanish  civilian,  man  or  woman,  and  the  price 
that  they  can  extort  without  apparently  running 
any  risk  of  eventual  punishment.  There  were 
several  cases  of  such  brigandage  in  1919-20,  in 
some  cases  accompanied  by  murder. 

Raisuli's  attitude  toward  the  Spanish  authorities 
and  troops  caused  great  anxiety  in  Spain.  The 
public  fretted  at  the  continual  loss  of  life  which 
his  resistance  to  the  Spanish  occupation  of  the 
country  occasioned,  and  General  Silvestre,  who 
commanded  the  troops  at  Laraiche,  was  recalled. 
Negotiations  were  once  more  entered  into  with 
Eaisuli.  The  terms  he  demanded  and  received 
were  extortionate ;  but  Spanish  public  opinion 
and  the  Madrid  press  demanded  a  termination  to 
the  constant  and  often  heavy  losses  that  the  troops 
were  suffering.  His  terms  had  to  be  accepted. 
He  received  a  little  native  army  of  his  own,  to 
be  paid  and  armed  by  Spain,  a  large  monthly 
stipend,  and  a  host  of  minor  favours.  He  became 
practically  dictator  of  the  north-western  part  of  the 
Spanish  zone,  governing  Spaniard  and  Moor  alike. 
His  own  "  zone  "  was  clearly  demarcated,  and  woe 
betide  any  Spaniard  who  attempted  to  pass  his 
frontier  and  enter  the  country  under  his  juris- 
diction. The  roads  were  closed,  and  there  was 
insecurity  under  the  very  walls  of  Ceuta  and 
Tetuan. 

Raisuli  was  an  agent  of  the  Germans  long  before 


248  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

the  war.  He  had  made  contracts  with  the  famous 
Mannesman!!  Brothers  with  reference  to  mining 
in  the  mountain  districts,  which  practically  closed 
those  regions  to  other  nationalities  and  other 
companies.  When  war  broke  out  he  continued 
his  friendly  relations  with  the  German  Consuls 
at  Tetuan  and  Laraiche,  and  with  the  many 
German  secret  agents  that  the  Spanish  zone 
harboured.  Under  their  guidance  he  gave  active 
assistance  to  German  criminal  intrigue  and  pro- 
paganda, and  was  in  direct  relations  with  the 
German  Embassy  at  Madrid.  The  '  Times '  of 
3rd  September  1918  published  a  translation  of  a 
letter  from  the  German  Embassy  to  Raisuli, 
which  contained  amongst  other  things  a  definite 
promise  of  arms  and  ammunition. 

To  those  who  have  no  personal  knowledge  of 
the  mountain  tribes  of  Morocco,  the  perpetual 
state  of  anarchy  in  which  they  live,  the  oppression 
by  their  lawful  and  unlawful  chiefs,  the  revenge 
and  murder  must  seem  incredible. 

In  the  An j  era  tribe  in  the  early  years  of  this 
century  there  were  two  great  families,  the  Deilans 
and  the  Duas.  Both  were  amongst  my  intimate 
friends.  I  had  been — always  dressed  as  a  native 
and  always  received  as  a  welcome  guest — at  the 
weddings  of  several  of  the  Sheikh  Deilan's  sons 
in  their  village  on  the  mountain-tops,  where 
hundreds  of  the  tribesmen  would  be  collected 
spending  the  moonlight  nights  in  feasting  and 
singing,  for  the  time  of  full  moon,  and  generally 
late  spring,  summer,  or  early  autumn  were  chosen 


RAISULI  249 

for  these  festivities.  What  wonderful  nights  they 
were  !  On  the  most  level  spot  that  could  be  found  \ 
in  the  neighbourhood  of  the  village  the  moun- 
taineers would  congregate,  leaving  an  open  circular 
space  in  their  centre,  with  vacant  "  aisles "  in 
the  closely-gathered  throng  radiating  into  the 
crowd.  To  the  music  of  shrill  pipes  and  drums 
— wild  exhilarating  music  to  those  who  have 
learned  to  appreciate  it — the  dancers,  trained  boys, 
would  take  up  their  stand  in  the  centre  and  slowly 
at  first,  then  faster,  begin  to  dance.  These  moun- 
tain dances  have  nothing  in  common  with  the 
ordinary  oriental  dance  that  is  witnessed  in  the 
towns  and  in  the  plains.  There  is  none  of  the 
inartistic  and  suggestive  wriggling  that  to  the 
European  point  of  view  is  so  ungraceful.  Dressed 
in  long  loose  white  garments,  almost  reaching  to 
their  feet,  with  flowing  sleeves  held  back  by  cords 
of  coloured  silk,  and  with  a  small  scarf  thrown 
over  the  head  so  as  to  half  veil  the  face,  the 
youths  moved  gracefully  in  and  out,  each  dancing 
alone,  and  yet  fitting  his  dance  into  a  plan  of 
concerted  movement. 

The  mountain  dancing  begins  by  the  performers 
standing  motionless  for  a  few  moments,  the  head 
thrown  back,  and  the  arms  loosely  falling  to  the 
side.  Then,  to  the  time  of  the  music,  there  is  a 
sudden  quick  movement  of  the  feet — a  little  soft 
stamping — but  without  the  least  motion  of  the 
body.  As  the  musicians  increase  their  energy  the 
dancer's  body  takes  life.  The  movement  of  the 
feet  is  accentuated,  and  suddenly  he  glides  forward 


250  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

toward  his  audience,  with  outstretched  arms, 
raising  the  scarf  from  the  face  for  a  moment,  and 
then  once  more  the  body  becomes  motionless. 
But,  as  if  against  his  will,  the  music  conquers  him. 
The  movements  become  more  general.  The  feet 
are  raised  higher  from  the  ground,  and  the  dancer 
gyrates  and  falls  on  one  knee,  rises  again  and  glides, 
holding  the  body  almost  motionless,  up  the  empty 
aisles  that  lie  open  between  the  sections  of  the 
crowd.  Never  is  the  graceful  posing  abandoned ; 
the  veil,  now  half  raised,  now  drawn  down  again, 
the  little  tremble  of  the  shoulders  and  the  gliding 
movement  of  the  feet — all  has  a  charm  and  artistic 
merit.  Every  now  and  again,  with  a  quick  turning 
movement  of  the  body,  which  sends  the  loose  folds 
of  the  long  white  garment  floating  round  him,  the 
dancer  falls  on  one  knee  before  one  of  the  guests, 
and,  removing  the  veil,  awaits  the  pressing  of  a 
silver  coin  upon  his  forehead,  and  to  receive  the 
exaggerated  and  poetical  compliments  of  the  donor. 
There  is  one  movement  in  these  dances  which 
is  admirable,  though  there  are  few  who  can  accom- 
plish it,  for  it  means  a  complete  subjection  and 
training  of  the  muscles.  The  dancer  suddenly 
stands  erect  with  outstretched  arms,  the  head 
thrown  back.  Then  from  his  feet  up  a  little 
trembling — a  little  shudder,  as  it  were — passes  up 
the  body,  to  die  away  in  the  tips  of  the  fingers 
of  the  outstretched  hands.  In  its  upward  move- 
ment each  portion  of  the  limbs  and  body  trembles 
alone ;  the  rest  is  motionless,  and  even  the 
trembling  is  so  delicate  that  it  might  pass  almost 


RAISULI  251 

unperceived.  The  rigidity  of  the  body  is  undis- 
turbed, and  one  feels  rather  than  sees  this  ascending 
"  nervous  thrill "  which  illumines  the  figure,  as 
though  giving  life  to  a  statue. 

But  I  digress.  The  Deilans  and  the  Duas  were 
the  great  families  of  the  An j  era  tribe.  Of  the  two 
the  Deilans  were  the  most  powerful,  for  the  old 
Sheikh  had  many  sons  and  nephews  and  kinsfolk. 
Naturally  the  eternal  jealousy  arose,  and  ended 
in  an  open  quarrel.  For  a  time  the  two  families 
lived  apart,  but  in  the  end  a  reconciliation  was 
arranged.  Deilan  and  his  family  visited  Duas  to 
partake  of  a  great  feast  to  celebrate  the  termina- 
tion of  their  quarrel.  While  seated  over  the 
steaming  savoury  dishes  in  the  courtyard  of  Duas's 
house  a  signal  was  given,  and  Deilan  and  his  sons 
were  shot,  many  of  his  retainers  also  falling 
victims  to  the  carefully-prepared  treachery.  For 
a  time  Duas  was  undisputed  chief  of  the  tribe 
in  his  stronghold  on  the  very  summit  of  a  moun- 
tain. I  had  been  a  prisoner  in  this  house  not  long 
before  for  a  few  days — during  the  latter  part  of 
the  time  when  I  was  taken  by  Raisuli — and  my 
recollection  of  Duas,  whom  I  knew  well,  and  of 
his  household  is  a  pleasant  one.  I  was  treated 
not  only  with  respect  but  also  with  great  friendli- 
ness, and  my  time  of  captivity  was  rendered  as 
easy  and  as  pleasant  as  possible. 

Then,  a  little  later,  the  Duas  family  began  to 
pay  the  penalty  of  their  treachery  and  murder. 
One  by  one  they  were  "  sniped  "  and  died.  Some- 
times it  was  by  day,  sometimes  by  night,  but  always 


252  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

a  well-directed  and  unfailing  bullet  from  a  Mauser 
rifle,  fired  from  the  rocks  or  brushwood.  Then 
came  the  turn  of  Duas  himself.  He  was  riding  a 
mule  on  his  way  to  a  local  market  surrounded  by 
his  retainers.  The  bullet  seemed  to  avoid  his  men, 
and  found  its  mark  in  their  chief.  He  fell  dead. 
And  so  the  blood-feud  went  on,  carried  out  by 
one  man  alone.  He  was  a  nephew  of  the  Sheikh 
Deilan,  by  name  Ben  Ahmed,  who  had  escaped 
the  massacre  at  Duas's  house.  I  knew  him  well 
— a  handsome  young  man,  not  knowing  what 
fear  meant  and  sworn  to  revenge.  He  was  shot 
at  last,  but  he  had  killed  Duas  and  eleven  members 
of  his  family.  The  names  of  Duas  and  Deilan  are 
already  almost  forgotten  in  the  An j  era.  If  any 
members  of  the  families  still  live  they  have  fallen 
to  the  unimportance  of  ordinary  tribesmen,  and 
others  have  arisen  in  their  place. 

Of  one  other  Anjera  chief  a  few  words  must  be 
said.  Of  all  my  friends  amongst  the  mountaineers 
he  was  the  one  whose  friendship  I  most  valued 
and  appreciated.  Sid  El  Arbi  bel  Aysh  was  a 
member  of  an  important  Shereefian  family  of  the 
Anjera,  and  a  direct  descendant  of  the  Prophet 
Mohammed,  and  a  brigand  as  well — the  two 
professions  so  often  go  together  in  Morocco  !  Of 
undoubted  courage — the  Spaniards  gave  him  the 
name  of  "  Valiente  " — he  had  taken  part  in  many 
tribal  fights,  and  once,  with  a  handful  of  his 
followers,  had  held  his  mountain  fastness  against 
several  hundred  tribesmen.  His  aim  was  unerring, 
and  woe  betide  the  man  at  whom  he  shot.  Up 


RAISULI  253 

to  the  end  of  his  short  life — he  was  killed  in  1915 
— he  was  a  constant  visitor  of  my  house,  coming 
regularly  from  his  mountain  home  to  spend  a 
week  or  so  at  Tangier.  He  won  the  heart  of 
every  one  he  met — a  brigand  perhaps,  but  a 
brigand  against  whom  no  accusation  of  cruelty 
was  ever  made.  With  the  hereditary  manner  of 
a  chief  whose  family  originated  1300  years  ago 
with  the  Prophet  Mohammed,  with  a  presence 
of  much  grace  and  manly  beauty,  with  a  voice 
that  charmed  and  a  personality  that  attracted, 
Sid  El  Arbi  bel  Aysh  was  the  perfect  type  of 
Moroccan  mountaineer  gentleman.  His  open  smile, 
his  good-natured  wit,  rendered  him  a  persona  grata 
everywhere,  and  nowhere  was  he  more  welcome 
than  in  my  house. 

Sid  El  Arbi's  moral  courage  was  as  great  as  hik 
physical  courage,  for  he  held  himself  aloof  froni 
all  his  tribe  when  in  1913  they  declared  war  on 
the  Spaniards.  For  a  long  time  he  refused  to 
fight,  though  thereby  endangering  his  own  life, 
for  his  fellow-tribesmen  at  one  moment  meditated 
his  assassination  on  this  account.  Unfortunately, 
however,  the  Spaniards  did  not  appreciate  his 
action,  nor  know  how  to  turn  it  to  their  benefit ; 
and  yet  he  was  perhaps  the  only  loyal  friend  upon 
whom  they  could  have  counted  in  the  Anjera. 
In  the  question  of  a  sale  of  some  of  his  lands, 
with  the  accompanying  water  rights,  to  the  Spanish 
authorities  of  Ceuta,  he  was  treated  in  a  manner 
that  is  best  left  undescribed.  Briefly,  he  never 
received  but  a  small  portion  of  the  purchase  price. 


254  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

Every  advantage  had  been  taken  of  his  goodwill 
to  bargain  over  the  transaction  till  the  sum  agreed 
upon  was  preposterously  small,  and  even  most  of 
that  he  never  got.  Exasperated  at  this  treatment, 
and  urged  by  the  gibes  of  his  tribesmen,  he  eventu- 
ally took  up  arms  against  the  Spaniards.  A  very 
few  weeks  later  he  was  killed  in  battle,  struck  down 
by  a  fragment  of  a  shell. 

Shortly  before  his  death  I  had  arranged  an 
interview  between  him  and  a  high  Spanish  author- 
ity, in  the  hopes  of  bringing  about  a  reconciliation 
and  of  obtaining  Sid  El  Arbi  bel  Aysh's  influence 
in  the  interests  of  peace.  Unfortunately  the 
Spanish  official  did  not  realise  that  he  was  dealing 
not  only  with  a  powerful  young  chieftain  but  also 
with  a  member  of  one  of  the  oldest  families  in 
Morocco — and,  moreover,  a  gentleman.  With  a 
want  of  tact  that  amounted  almost  to  insult,  the 
Spaniard  asked  Sid  El  Arbi  whether  the  real  reason 
of  his  taking  up  arms  against  them  was  because  his 
wives  had  stigmatised  him  as  a  coward  and  had 
rendered  his  life  unbearable  at  home.  In  Moslem 
countries  one  does  not  talk  to  a  man  of  his  women, 
but  Sid  El  Arbi  laughed  and  replied,  "  No,  that 
was  scarcely  the  reason." 

"  I  suppose  they  called  you  a  '  coward '  and  a 
6  Christian '  for  not  taking  up  arms  against  us  ?  " 
continued  the  unfortunate  Spaniard. 

I  tried  my  best  to  change  the  conversation  into 
other  channels,  but  it  was  too  late.  Again  Sid  El 
Arbi  laughed. 

"  No,"  he  replied  again,  "  it  was  not  that.    All 


RAISULI  255 

the  world  knows  I  am  not  a  coward,  and  some  of 
my  best  friends  are  Christians." 

"  Then  what  made  you  fight  us  ?  " 

"  I  will  teU  you,"  said  Sid  El  Arbi,  still  smiling, 
but  very  angry.  "  I  bore  all  the  gibes  till  one  day, 
in  desperation,  I  was  called  a  '  Spaniard.'  That 
insult  was  more  than  human  nature  could  bear. ,  _ 
From  that  moment  I  have  been  at  war  with  you." 
Still  smiling,  Sid  El  Arbi  rose,  and,  breaking  off 
his  interview  before  its  object  had  been  reached, 
bade  adieu  to  our  host  and  left  the  house. 

It  was  the  final  straw.  He  returned  to  the 
An j  era,  and  died  fighting  a  short  time  after. 

The  occupation  of  Tetuan  by  the  Spaniards  in 
1912  put_an_end  to  all  travel  in  the  mountains 
of  North- West  Morocco,  where  in  the  past  I  had 
spent  so  many  pleasant  months,  fishing  for  trout 
and  shooting.  A  few  months  before  the  Spanish 
troops  entered  the  town  the  roads  were  still  safe, 
and  English  ladies  rode  alone  over  the  forty-two- 
mile  track  that  led  from  that  town  to  Tangier. 
But  nowadays  the  tribes  have  completely  changed 
in  character,  for  they  have  become  distrust- 
ful, and  are  always  at  war.  As  late  as  the 
spring  of  1912  Sir  Reginald  Lister,  who  was 
British  Minister  to  Morocco — he  died,  alas  !  in 
November  the  same  year — and  I  made  several 
excursions  overland  to  Tetuan  unaccompanied  by 
any  one  except  our  grooms.  Often  a  mounted 
soldier  of  the  police  would  start  with  us,  but  we 
always  left  him  far  behind,  and  no  doubt  he  would 
turn  back.  Sir  Reginald  had  bought  and  restored 


256  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

a  delightful  little  Moorish  house  in  Tetuan,  and 
there  we  spent  our  week-ends.  We  would  leave 
Tangier  at  eight  in  the  morning,  and  arrive  at 
Tetuan  at  three  in  the  afternoon,  with  an  hour 
for  lunch  en  route  :  not  bad  going,  for  the  distance 
is  forty-two  miles,  and  the  road  in  many  places  a 
mere  stony  track.  Sometimes,  if  the  going  was 
heavy,  we  changed  horses  half  -  way,  but  as  a 
rule  I  rode  one  horse  right  through.  From  Tetuan, 
delightfully  situated  overlooking  the  wide  valley, 
with  its  background  of  rugged  peaks,  we  would 
make  excursions  to  the  country  round,  with  merely 
a  man  who  knew  the  country  as  a  guide  and  our 
grooms.  Leaving  early  in  the  mornings,  we  rode 
to  the  mountain  villages,  to  meet  everywhere 
with  the  kindest  of  welcomes  from  the  people. 
Some  of  these  villages  had  seldom— and  perhaps 
never — been  visited  by  Europeans,  and  our  coming 
caused  much  interest.  At  times  the  tracks  were 
too  rough  for  our  horses,  and  we  would  leave  them 
in  charge  of  our  men,  and  scramble  up  the  rocks 
to  the  little  groups  of  thatched  huts  that  seemed 
to  hang  to  the  mountain-side.  The  views  were 
always  beautiful,  often  extending  over  the  who]e 
Straits  of  Gibraltar,  which  seemed  but  a  narrow 
stream  dividing  the  rugged  mountains  of  Africa 
from  Europe. 

Then  came  the  Spanish  occupation,  and  the 
closing  of  all  this  country.  With  all  the  troops  at 
their  disposal,  it  took  several  years  before  these 
villages  were  reached.  The  mountains,  where 
many  Europeans  used  to  camp  and  shoot  in 


RAISULI  257 

perfect  security,  are  as  difficult  of  access  to-day 
as  the  wildest  regions  of  Central  Africa,  and  far 
more  unsafe.  While  in  the  French  Protectorate 
immense  regions,  unexplored  until  the  advent  of 
the  French,  can  be  travelled  in  perfect  security 
— often  by  train  or  motor  —  the  advent  of  the 
Spaniards  has,  on  the  contrary,  tended  to  close 
the  greater  part  of  the  zone  which  lies  under 
their  influence,  many  parts  of  which  were  formerly 
open  to  travellers  and  sportsmen. 

It  need  not  have  been  so.  At  first  things 
went  tolerably  well,  but  want  of  knowledge  of 
the  natives  and  their  ways,  wflnt-  of  tact,  and 
want  of  generosity  quickly  brought  about  mis- 
understandings, with  the  result  which  exists  to-day 
— a  total  absence  of  security,  constant  aggression, 
and  little  accomplished. 

Throughout  the  whole  period  of  the  war  Raisuli 
maintained  this  pro-German  attitude.  He  pos- 
sessed at  the  ftflinf  fiTYiP-  f.frp  a.hanlnffi  npnfirlAnoA^ 

of  the  Spanish  Government,  which  supplied  him/,, 
with  almost  unlimited  sums  of  money,  with  rifles 
and  ammunition,  and  with  uniforms  for  his  native 
troops  and  foodstuffs  to  feed  them.  Any  one  who, 
from  knowledge  of  the  situation  or  of  the  man,  ven- 
tured to  express  an  opinion  that  Raisuli' s  sentiments 
toward  Spain  might  be  open  to  doubt,  was  assailed 
by  official  denunciations  and  press  attacks  from 
Madrid.  Yet  the  situation  was  perfectly  clear. 
Raisuli  was  gaining  time.  He  was  increasing  his 
wealth  and  his  means  of  resistance — if  the  situation 
should  require  resistance — and  gave  little  or  no 

R 


258  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

thought  to  any  one  or  anything  except  himself  and 
his  own  future.  I  sent  to  him  once  during  the  war 
and  asked  him  whether  it  was  true  he  was  taking 
German  money.  He  evaded  my  question  in  his 
answer.  He  replied,  "  If  the  British  or  French, 
or  any  other  nation  have  money  to  give  away,  I 
will  willingly  accept  it — the  more  the  better." 

He  worked  in  the  interests  of  Germany  because 
he  was  paid  to  do  so,  just  as  he  would  have  worked 
in  the  interests  of  any  other  country  under  similar 
circumstances.  When  Raisuli  realised  the  results 
of  the  war,  and  the  rejoicings  for  the  signature  of 
peace  were  being  held  at  Tangier  —  it  was  on 
14th  July  1919,  —  Raisuli  sent  to  me  to  say 
that  he  too  was  keeping  the  peace  by  having 
massacred  a  few  hundred  Spaniards.  He  congratu- 
lated France  and  England,  he  said,  on  having  got 
rid  of  Germany,  and  would  himself  rid  the  Allies 
"  of  another  enemy,  Spain."  So  much  for  his 
German  proclivities. 

At  the  end  of  the  war  the  condition  of  affairs 
in  the  Spanish  zone  was  frankly  impossible,  from 
every  one's  point  of  view.  The  Spaniards  had  put 
their  money  on  the  wrong  horse;  the  Allies  had 
won,  and  Madrid  had  to  explain  away  the  evil 
purposes  to  which  the  Spanish  Government  had 
allowed  its  zone  in  Morocco  to  be  put — and  it  was 
not  an  easy  explanation.  Too  late  they  began  to 
expel  the  German  spies  and  to  put  down  the 
intrigue  that  had  been  allowed  practically  free 
scope  up  to  then.  Nor  was  Spain's  own  position 
in  her  zone  a  pleasant  one.  Even  the  Spanish 


RAISULI  259 

High  Commissioner  was  to  all  intents  and  purposes 
under  Raisuli's  orders,  and  no  Spaniard  could 
travel  in  a  great  part  of  their  zone  without  a 
special  passport  from  the  brigand  chief.  One  or 
two  who  ventured  to  do  so  disappeared,  and  nothing 
more  was  heard  of  them. 

At  last  public  opinion  in  Spain  revolted.  Raisuli 
had  received  millions  of  pesetas  of  good  Spanish 
money  for  which  he  had  rendered  no  services,  unless 
the  prevention  of  Spanish  occupation  of  the  country 
can  be  considered  as  a  service.  General  Jordana, 
the  Spanish  High  Commissioner,  died  suddenly  in 
Tetuan,  and  the  Spanish  Government  decided  upon 
taking  action.  What  amounted  to  an  ultimatum 
was  sent  to  Raisuli — and  disregarded — and  a  crisis 
arose.  General  Berenguer,  an  able  Spanish  general 
with  considerable  knowledge  of  Morocco,  was  ap- 
pointed Spanish  High  Commissioner,  and  success- 
fully inaugurated  his  period  of  office  by  winning 
over  the  large  and  important  Anjera  tribe  to  the 
side  of  Spain.  But  even  he  made  too  sure  of 
success,  and  a  few  days  after  he  had  made  a 
declaration  to  the  "  Press "  stating  that  there 
would  be  no  more  fighting  in  Morocco,  the 
Spanish  forces  received  a  very  severe  check  at 
the  hands  of  Raisuli.  The  series  of  combats  of 
Wad  Ras,  began  on  llth  July,  and  lasted  till 
13th  July  1919.  The  Spanish  authorities  made 
every  attempt  to  hide  the  truth  of  what  had 
occurred,  but  failed.  All  the  assistance,  all  the 
money,  and  all  the  arms  the  Spaniards  had  for 
five  years  been  giving  to  Raisuli  were  now  turned 


260  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

against  the  donors,  as  any  one  who  really  knew  the 
situation  had  long  realised  must  ultimately  be 
the  case.  The  small  Spanish  force  operating  on 
the  north  crests  of  the  Wad  Ras  hills,  about  twenty 
miles  from  Tangier,  was  practically  cut  to  pieces. 
The  losses  have  never  been  published,  but  I  have 
every  reason  to  believe  that  they  were  about 
300  killed  and  probably  1000  wounded.  There 
were  no  prisoners,  and  the  Spanish  wounded  were 
massacred  to  a  man.  Not  only  were  Raisuli's 
forces,  thanks  to  the  generosity  of  the  very  people 
he  was  attacking,  well  armed,  but  they  were  also 
possessed  of  Spanish  uniforms,  disguised  in  which 
they  were  able  to  massacre  a  column  of  over  170 
soldiers.  To  add  to  the  horrors  of  this  episode, 
Raisuli's  tribesmen  came  provided  with  hand- 
grenades  and  asphyxiating  bombs.  This  disaster 
— for,  whatever  the  Spaniards  may  assert,  it  was 
a  disaster — led  to  fresh  revelations.  The  hospitals 
were  reported  to  be  in  a  shocking  state  of  neglect ; 
there  were  no  beds  for  the  wounded,  and  complete 
disorganisation  in  every  department. 

The  Spanish  Government  at  last  realised  that 
something  must  be  done,  or  a  continuance  of  the 
policy  hitherto  pursued  would  soon  prove  fatal  to 
Spanish  prestige,  not  only  in  Morocco  but  also 
in  Europe.  The  general  responsible  for  the  fate- 
ful incidents  of  July  was  dismissed,  and  General 
Silvestre,  a  well-known  enemy  of  Raisuli,  was  sent 
from  Spain  to  take  command.  Vast  quantities  of 
material  were  shipped  to  Africa,  including  aero- 
planes, tanks,  artillery,  rifles  and  ammunition,  and, 


RAISULI  261 

happily,  hospital  necessaries  in  sufficient  quantities. 
In  two  months  from  the  critical  days  of  July  the 
Spanish  army  in  Morocco  was  prepared  once  more 
to  advance  and  to  drive  Raisuli  from  his  mountain 
strongholds. 

The  new  campaign  began  on  27th  September 
1919.  Twelve  thousand  Spanish  troops  were  col- 
lected to  form  the  principal  columns  which  were 
to  encircle  the  Fondak  of  Wad  Ras,  whence 
Raisuli  held  the  road  leading  from  Tangier  to 
Tetuan.  In  former  days  this  road  was  open  to 
traffic,  and  parties  of  lady  tourists  often  rode  from 
Tangier  to  Tetuan  accompanied  only  by  a  native 
guide.  Since  the  occupation  of  Tetuan  by  the 
Spaniards,  Raisuli  had  closed  this  track  to  all 
but  natives.  Its  importance  to  the  Spaniards 
was  paramount,  for  it  forms  the  one  direct  means 
of  communication  between  the  district  of  Tetuan 
and  of  Laraiche  on  the  Atlantic  coast.  As  long 
as  Raisuli  held  the  Fondak  no  communication  was 
possible,  and  to  proceed  from  one  town  to  another 
in  the  Spanish  zone  the  only  means  was  by  sea. 
The  Spanish  forces  advanced  with  caution.  Rai- 
suli's  tribesmen  offered  no  great  resistance.  They 
were  powerless  in  the  presence  of  the  immense 
war  material  the  Spaniards  had  lately  brought  to 
the  scene  of  action.  Artillery  and  aeroplanes 
harassed  them.  Shells  and  bombs  burnt  their 
villages,  and  killed  their  women  and  children. 
The  odds  were  too  great.  For  a  moment  the 
operations  were  checked  by  a  small  revolt  of 
native  troops  behind  the  Spanish  lines.  Spanish 


262  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

officers  and  men  were  massacred  ;  but  the  mutiny 
was  suppressed,  and  the  columns,  attacking  from 
three  directions,  drew  near  the  Fondak. 

On  Saturday,  4th  October,  there  remained  only 
a  very  few  kilometres,  and  the  Spanish  troops 
had  already  begun  the  ascent  of  the  slopes  leading 
up  to  the  Fondak.  On  Sunday  morning  the  sur- 
rounding brush-covered  hills  were  heavily  bom- 
barded, and  the  troops  advanced  on  the  last  stage 
of  their  march,  burning  everything  that  would 
burn  en  route.  From  the  hills  above  Tangier  I 
could  see  the  bursting  shells,  the  explosions  of 
falling  bombs,  the  ruthless  destruction  of  villages 
by  fire — in  fact,  the  ruining  of  hundreds  of  families 
and  the  rendering  desolate  dozens  of  homes,  which 
marks  the  introduction  of  civilisation  into  this  part 
of  Morocco. 

And  somewhere  on  those  mountain-tops  Raisuli 
saw  it  too,  and  as  he  never  forgot  or  forgave  the 
destruction  of  his  castle  at  Zinat,  so  he  will  never 
forget  or  forgive  this  last  campaign.  He  may  be 
impotent  to  fight  a  force  numerically  more  than 
twice  his  own,  and  armed  with  every  modern  and 
hideous  appliance  of  war,  but,  if  I  know  his  char- 
acter and  his  warfare,  he  will  wage  a  guerilla 
campaign  of  midnight  attack  and  murder  that 
will  last  long  and  prove  costly  in  its  toll  of  lives 
amongst  the  invaders  of  his  country. 

The  solution  rests  with  the  Spaniards.  If  they 
bring  prosperity  and  justice  to  the  natives  of  their 
zone  they  will  be  left  in  peace.  At  present  they 
have  brought  neither,  but  much  may  be  hoped 


RAISULI  263 

from  the  Spanish  Government,  which  realises  that 
the  manner  of  their  occupation  of  Morocco  is  as 
important  for  the  good  name  of  Spain  as  is  their 
conduct  of  affairs  in  the  Peninsula  itself.  They 
must  not  forget  that  Raisuli  still  lives,  and  that  he 
is,  in  his  way,  the  biggest  man  in  Morocco. 

There  are  few  countries  that  could  produce  a 
Raisuli.  It  necessitates  an  environment  which 
exists,  perhaps  happily,  only  in  such  countries  as 
Morocco.  Yet  during  the  last  few  years  of  his 
career  he  has  made  himself  famous,  and  a  real 
touch  of  romance  surrounds  the  brigand,  who, 
born  of  an  aristocratic  family,  has  terrorised  and 
yet  in  a  way  protected  Tangier,  a  city  of  40,000 
inhabitants,  the  seat  of  a  dozen  legations.  In 
spite  of  his  celebrity,  very  few  Europeans  have 
ever  seen  him.  He  has  seldom,  if  ever,  been 
photographed,  and  never  written  his  name  in  the 
autograph  collector's  album.  He  has  been  through- 
out a  sort  of  mysterious  personage,  half -saint,  half- 
blackguard,  whom  every  courageous  male  tourist 
has  volunteered  to  capture,  and  many  a  still 
more  courageous  female  tourist  to  marry.  Mulai 
Ahmed  er-Raisuli  is  unique — and  perhaps,  after 
all,  one  of  his  kind  is  enough. 


SAINTS,  SHEREEFS,  AND   SINNERS 

THE  political  influence  that  the  Moslem  "  con- 
fraternities "  possess  in  Morocco  is  not  easy  to 
estimate.  In  ordinary  times  of  peace  and  pros- 
perity it  is  probably  very  small,  but  the  germ  of 
fanaticism  which  can  never  be  entirely  absent 
from  such  cults,  might  under  certain  circumstances 
become  a  dangerous  factor  in  the  situation. 

In  Morocco  reside  a  large  number  of  Shereefian 
families,  descendants  of  the  Prophet — foremost 
amongst  them  that  of  the  reigning  Sultan.  As 
Shereefs  they  claimed  in  the  past,  and  were  per- 
mitted, great  privileges.  They  were  universally 
respected,  not  only  as  forming  a  superior  and 
religious  nobility,  but  also  on  account  of  their 
great  local  influence,  which  they  used  as  a  means 
of  mediation  between  the  secular  authorities  and 
the  tribesmen.  Considered,  through  their  posses- 
sion of  the  holy  "Baraka" — the  birthright  of  all 
descendants  of  the  Prophet — as  men  to  whom 
ordinary  laws  were  not  applicable,  these  great 
families,  especially  certain  selected  representatives 
of  them,  possessed  extraordinary  influence  and 
power.  Their  advice  was  sought,  and  followed, 
by  the  country  people  on  every  question,  and 


266  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

their  decisions  were  accepted  as  final  in  all  points 
in  dispute,  even  though  at  times  their  judgments 
might  be  contrary  to  the  unalterable  laws  of  Islam. 
Not  only  did  these  Shereefs  live  beyond  the  reach 
of  the  ordinary  civil  and  criminal  laws,  they  were 
also  considered  as  meriting  no  punishment  for  their 
sins.  This  immunity  from  the  laws  of  God  and 
man  gave  them  unlimited  opportunity — of  which 
they  were  usually  not  slow  to  take  advantage — to 
practise  extortion  and  tyranny,  "  frailties  "  which 
were  accepted  in  silence  by  the  people,  who  saw, 
or  imagined  they  saw,  in  every  act  and  deed  of 
their  Shereefs  the  guidance  of  the  hand  of  God. 

Existing  largely  on  offerings  brought  to  them, 
or  to  the  tombs  of  their  ancestors,  by  pious  pil- 
grims, and  upon  a  system  of  religious  taxation, 
the  Shereefian  families  formed  a  class  entirely 
apart,  and  though  often  enough  thoroughly  bad, 
they  not  unseldom  were  of  great  use  in  settling 
intertribal  disputes  and  preventing  bloodshed. 

To  such  a  class  European  invasion,  or  any  form 
of  stable  and  just  government,  meant  ruin,  and 
it  is  not  surprising  that  it  was  the  Shereefian 
families  who  have  in  the  past  always  been  averse 

any  kind  of  reform  in  Morocco. 

The  arrival  of  the  French  in  the  country  was 
the  deathblow  to  the  irregular  influence  of  these 
families — not,  be  it  understood,  that  any  repression 
took  place,  but  from  the  fact  that  once  peace  and 
security  existed  in  the  country  there  was  no  longer 
any  necessity  for  them.  Intertribal  disputes 
ceased  with  the  advent  of  good  government,  and 


SAINTS,   SHEREEFS,  AND  SINNERS    267 

the  intervention  of  the  Shereefs  ceased  with  it. 
The  system  of  general  and  just  taxation  put  a 
stop  to  much  of  the  revenues  of  these  families, 
for  there  was  no  longer  any  necessity  for  the  tribes- 
men to  pay  large  sums  to  an  influential  Shereef 
in  order  to  avoid  having  to  pay  still  larger  ones 
to  the  Moorish  Government.  Although  it  has  been 
the  policy  of  the  French  to  uphold  rather  than  to 
suppress  the  great  influential  families  of  Morocco, 
circumstances  have  nevertheless  lessened  their 
repute  and  prestige.  The  native  himself  has 
"  found  them  out."  The  spiritual  benefits  they 
promised  or  bestowed — paid  for  at  a  rather  high 
price — were  not  as  valuable  as  the  temporal 
benefits  which  accrue  from  a  just  and  reasonable 
Government.  He  has  found  that  he  can  claim 
as  his  right,  and  not  as  a  privilege  to  be  pur- 
chased by  money,  the  justice  and  assistance  which 
he  previously  had  to  buy,  often  without  tangible 
results.  The  famous  Shereefian  families  of  Wazzan, 
Bou  Jad,  and  Tamshlat  are  becoming  year  by  year 
more  dependent  upon  their  agricultural  estates 
for  their  wellbeing,  owing  to  the  falling-off  in  the 
offerings  of  the  "  faithful."  The  Moor  who  formerly 
put  a  portion  of  his  fortune  into  unproductive 
religious  investments  in  the  form  of  offerings  to 
Shereefs,  now  puts  it  into  real  estate.  He  still 
respects  the  Shereefs,  he  still  kisses  the  hem  of 
their  robes,  but  he  keeps  his  money  for  himself. 

This  gradual  disappearance  of  reverence  toward 
the  living  descendants  of  the  Prophet  has  not  to 
any  great  extent  diminished  the  veneration  that 


268  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

is  paid  to  the  tombs  of  deceased  saints.  Of  the 
two  this  veneration  of  the  deceased  is  preferable 
to  that  of  the  living,  for  at  all  events  the  buried 
Shereef  is  dead  and  unable  to  stir  up  strife  and 
X.  rebellion.  The  French  policy  has  been  extremely 
able  with  regard  to  the  "  holy  places "  and 
"  tombs  " — for  which  the  authorities  demand  the 
greatest  respect,  and  which  they  themselves  treat 
with  respect,  even  so  far  as  assisting  by  influence 
and  gifts  the  prestige  of  the  tomb  or  mosque  as 
the  case  may  be.  It  is  this  respect  for  the  person 
and  tradition  of  dead  saints  and  scholars  that  has 
given  so  strong  an  impetus  to  the  "  confraternities  " 
or  sects  of  Moslem  Morocco. 

The  study  of  the  introduction  of  these  "  con- 
fraternities "  is  beyond  the  scope  of  this  work. 
It  is  sufficient  to  state  that  many  of  them  had 
their  origin  in  the  early  days  of  Islam,  some  even 
before  the  time  of  the  Baghdad  Khalifs,  whose 
literary  tastes  and  erudition  introduced  the  ideas 
of  Indian  and  Greek  philosophy  into  a  religion  the 
principal  attribute  of  which  is  its  simplicity  and  lack 
of  imagination.  It  may  almost  be  said  that  the 
only  want  of  judgment  exhibited  by  Mohammed 
in  originating  the  faith  of  Islam  was  in  depriving 
his  followers  of  what  is  so  necessary  to  all  oriental 
character,  an  environment  of  mysticism.  But  the 
want  supplied  itself,  for  so  prosaic  a  religion  as 
Islam  in  its  crude  form  was  irreconcilable  with 
the  traditions  and  characteristics  of  the  Arab 
nature.  One  of  the  first  innovations  was  the 
invention  of  the  "  Baraka  " — or  holy  birthright 


SAINTS,   SHEREEFS,  AND  SINNERS    269 

pertaining  to  descendants  of  the  Prophet — which 
doctrine  helped  not  a  little  to  cause  the  first 
great  split  in  Islam,  the  separation  of  the  Sunni 
and  the  Sheiya.  By  the  close  of  the  second  century 
A.H.  the  traditions  of  Pantheism  and  the  learning 
of  India  and  Greece  had  so  permeated  the  Moslem 
world  that  there  arose  an  old  cult  under  a  new 
name — Sufism — the  traces  of  which  exist  to-day 
in  every  one  of  the  sects  and  "  confraternities  "of 
Morocco. 

More  than  the  briefest  survey  of  Sufism  is  im- 
possible here,  but  brief  as  it  is,  it  will  be  sufficient 
to  show  how  entirely  the  doctrine  stands  apart 
from  orthodox  Islam. 

^ 

To  the  Sufi  the  world  is  an  illusion.  It  is  merely 
a  collection  and  massing  together  of  the  shapes  and 
forms  of  things  which  have  no  real  existence,  being 
but  the  lights  and  shadows  of  the  reflection  and 
"  essence  "  of  the  Deity.  Given  this  theory,  the 
Sufi  considers  that  the  highest  ideal  of  life,  and  its 
ultimate  aim,  is  the  merging  of  all  individuality 
in  this  vague  "  essence  "  of  the  Deity.  It  can  well 
be  imagined  how  a  doctrine  of  such  a  character 
can  be  misunderstood  and  misconstrued  amongst 
an  ignorant  people,  and  to-day,  in  the  place  of 
pure  Sufism,  with  its  seeking  after  ideals,  we  find 
a  number  of  sects,  one  and  all  founded  on  Sufism, 
but  most  of  them  erring  far  from  its  primitive 
aim.  Yet  the  very  incomprehensibleness  of  these 
doctrines  to  the  larger  part  of  the  people  who 
have  adopted  them  has  given  a  great  impetus  to 
the  success  of  these  "  confraternities."  The  real 


270  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

philosophy  has  been  lost,  and  its  place  has  been 
taken  by  a  belief,  the  more  attractive  in  that  it 
is  inexplicable,  that  the  repetition  of  certain 
prayers  and  extracts  from  the  Koran  has  mystical 
powers  tending  to  accomplish  the  aim  in  view, 
the  effacement  of  individuality.  It  is  curious 
that  no  cabalistic  forms  are  used  in  this  "  dikr  " 
— or  formulae — and  that  even  to  the  most  strict 
Moslem  it  would  be  difficult  to  find  fault  with  the 
outward  and  visible  form  of  the  tenets  of  the 
"  confraternities."  Yet  though  in  all  North  Africa 
the  greater  part  of  the  population  adheres  to  the 
orthodox  Maleki  school  of  Islam,  these  sects  are 
so  impregnated  with  Sufism,  and  even  with  Neo- 
Platonism,  as  to  be,  one  and  all,  completely 
unorthodox. 

In  order  that  the  importance  of  these  sects  may 
be  realised,  a  few  words  are  necessary  as  to  their 
organisation,  for  they  owe  their  strength  princi- 
pally to  the  system  by  which  the  various  centres 
are  kept  in  touch  with  one  another,  and  obedience 
to  supreme  orders  guaranteed. 

Each  "  confraternity  "  has  its  central  "  zaouia  " 
or  sanctuary,  where  either  the  chief  of  the  sect 
resides  or  its  founder  is  buried.  From  these  centres 
their  policy  is  promulgated,  and  by  means  of  sub- 
ordinate "  zaouias,"  each  under  the  charge  of  a 
spiritual  "  Sheikh  "  or  "  mokaddem,"  orders  are 
passed  on  to  the  devotees.  The  larger  "  zaouias  " 
consist  usually  of  a  group  of  buildings  containing 
a  mosque  and  quarters  for  pilgrims,  and  for  the 
education  of  the  "  tholba,"  or  scholars,  all  of  whom 


SAINTS,   SHEREEFS,  AND  SINNERS    271 

are  kept  supplied  with  food  from  the  funds  at  the 
disposal  of  the  local  officials.  It  is  at  these 
"  zaouias "  that  the  initiation  of  the  devotees 
takes  place,  and  that  the  followers  of  each  sect 
gather  together  from  time  to  time  for  religious 
intercourse  and  services.  Scarcely  a  town  exists 
in  Morocco  that  has  not  "  zaouias  "  of  at  least 
half  a  dozen  saints.  All  over  the  country  districts, 
too,  they  are  found,  often  consisting  of  only  a 
thatch  hut  in  the  vicinity  of  some  revered 
tomb,  but  none  the  less  a  spot  for  the  concentra- 
tion of  the  devotees,  and  the  object  of  many  a  long 
and  weary  pilgrimage. 

It  is  not  necessary  that  the  "  Sheikhs  "  of  the 
sects,  or  even  the  founder,  should  be  a  descendant 
of  the  Prophet,  though  such  is  often  the  case. 
In  some  sects  the  choice  of  the  supreme  chief  is 
elective,  in  some  it  is  hereditary,  as  in  the  Wazzan 
family.  In  others,  again,  it  is  neither  elective  nor 
hereditary,  it  being  left  to  divine  agency  to  dis- 
close who  the  heaven-appointed  "  Sheikh  "  may 
be.  In  this  latter  case,  on  the  death  of  a  "  Sheikh," 
no  move  is  made  to  name  or  discover  his  successor. 
In  due  time  it  "  becomes  known  "  that  a  certain 
adept  at  a  certain  spot  is  the  new  chief,  and  he  is 
at  once  accepted  as  the  spiritual  leader.  He  need 
perform  no  miracle ;  he  need  possess  no  mark  or 
sign  to  disclose  his  calling ;  he  may  be,  and 
generally  is,  of  extreme  poverty ;  and  it  is  not 
apparently  necessary  that  he  should  have  any 
great  personal  qualifications.  There  can  be  no 
doubt  that  this  curious  system  of  nominating 


272  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

their  religious  "  Sheikhs,"  though  not  always 
put  into  practice  and  becoming  rarer,  is  but  an 
example  of  the  secrecy  with  which  their  plans  are 
made  and  carried  out,  and  that  the  man  is  really 
chosen  by  a  secret  council  without  even  the  know- 
ledge of  the  individual  himself.  Word  is  sur- 
reptitiously sent  to  the  heads  of  all  the  "  zaouias," 
and  upon  a  given  day  it  is  announced  to  the  faith- 
ful that  a  new  "  Sheikh "  has  "  appeared " 
in  such  and  such  a  spot.  The  frequenters  of 
"  zaouias,"  hundreds  of  miles  apart,  obtain  the 
information  upon  the  same  day,  and  the  credulous 
people  consider  it  a  revelation  from  God.  The 
"  Derkaoua "  are  the  principal  sect  that  follow 
this  course. 

In  the  hands  of  the  supreme  chief  lies  the  selec- 
tion of  the  minor  "  Sheikhs,"  who  in  turn  possess 
certain  limited  powers  in  the  nominating  of  the 
"  mokaddems,"  or  lesser  officials,  all  of  whom 
have  the  right,  as  a  rule,  of  initiating  devotees, 
and  all  of  whom  are  agents  for  the  collection  of 
funds. 

The  general  and  public  tenets  of  the  sects  are 
good  enough:  chastity, patience,  poverty,  obedience, 
and  prayer  are  the  principal  teachings,  though  the 
"  derouich,"  who  abandons  the  ways  of  the  world, 
and  the  "  khoddam,"  who  is  merely  an  adherent, 
follow  different  rules  of  life  and  conduct. 

The  importance  of  these  Moroccan  confra- 
ternities depends  entirely  upon  the  political  in- 
fluence that  they  are  able  to  exert.  When  left  to 
themselves,  in  ordinary  times,  they  consist  of

little  more  than  religious  institutions  and  brother- 
hoods, of  which  the  concealed  energies,  such  as 
they  are,  are  not  called  forth  by  circumstances. 
It  is  only  when  they  come  directly  into  contact 
with  Europe  and  Europeans  that  their  essentially 
religious  features  might  become  impregnated  with 
anti-Christian  policy.  A  "  Jehad  "  or  "  Holy  War," 
accepted  and  furthered  by  the  united  sects  of 
Morocco,  might  be  very  dangerous,  but,  happily, 
it  is  also  very  improbable. 

Perhaps  the  most  renowned  of  all  the  Shereefian 
families  of  Morocco  is  that  of  Wazzan  (Ouezzan). 
Descended  from  the  Prophet,  the  Shorfa  of  Wazzan 
can  boast  of  an  unbroken  lineage  for  thirteen 
centuries,  though  it  was  not  until  a  couple  of 
hundred  years  ago  that  they  became  of  great 
account.  Up  to  that  period  they  had  apparently 
lived  the  ordinary  devout  lives  of  people  of  holy 
descent,  no  doubt  looked  up  to  and  probably  the 
recipients  of  many  offerings.  The  last  few  genera- 
tions have,  however,  enjoyed  a  great  renown 
throughout  Morocco — Mulai  Abdullah  Shereef,  Sid 
el  Haj  el-Arbi,  and  Sid  el-Haj  Abdesalam.  The 
last  named,  who  died  some  twenty-five  years  ago, 
married  an  English  lady,  still  residing  at  Tangier, 
who  carries  on  there  many  good  and  charitable 
works  amongst  the  Moors.  It  was  she  who  intro- 
duced vaccination  into  the  country,  and  herself 
has  vaccinated  many  thousands  of  the  people. 
She  is  much  loved  by  the  Moors  and  respected  by 
the  Europeans.  Her  husband,  Sid  el-Haj  Abd- 
esalam, had,  by  previous  marriages  with  native

women,  three  sons,  who  at  the  time  of  which  I 
write — the  end  of  the  'eighties  and  the  early 
'nineties  of  the  last  century — resided  in  Wazzan. 
In  my  early  journeys  I  often  visited  this  fanatical 
and  difficult  district,  and  became  great  friends  of 
the  two  elder  brothers.  In  1889-90  I  spent  many 
months  at  their  little  religious  Court,  the  only 
European  in  any  of  those  regions. 

It  was  a  life  of  great  interest :  there  were 
constant  relays  of  pilgrims,  who  came  to  pray 
at  the  tombs  of  the  ancestors  of  the  family  and 
to  bring  offerings  to  its  living  members.  They 
would  arrive  by  dozens,  and  sometimes  by  hun- 
dreds— men,  women,  and  children,  with  caravans 
of  mules,  ponies,  and  camels,  laden  with  grain  and 
other  products  of  the  country  as  an  offering  to  the 
"  House  of  Surety,"  as  it  was  called  by  the  natives. 
These  pilgrims,  who  were  lodged  and  fed  by  the 
Shereefs,  were  generally  received  in  audience  the 
day  after  their  arrival.  The  Shereefs,  Mulai  el-Arbi 
and  Sidi  Mohamed,  received  them  separately, 
either  in  their  little  walled  gardens,  full  of  running 
water  and  flowers,  or  else  in  one  of  the  courtyards 
of  the  "  zaouia  "  or  sanctuary.  Often  Mulai  el- 
Arbi  would  be  seated  just  inside  an  open  window, 
through  which  the  passing  pilgrims  could  bend  to 
kiss  his  holy  raiment,  while  an  offering  in  money 
was  laid  upon  the  window-sill,  to  be  dropped  into 
a  basket  by  the  Shereef  as  each  pilgrim  proceeded 
on  his  way.  When  the  entire  string  of  visitors 
had  passed,  Mulai  el-Arbi  would  count  his  newly- 
acquired  wealth.  Although  the  sums  were  never 


SAINTS,   SHEREEFS,  AND  SINNERS    275 

great — for  the  population  of  Morocco  was  in  its 
worst  days  of  oppression — the  total  received  during 
the  autumn  and  winter  pilgrim  season  was  no 
mean  one. 

The  two  brothers,  Mulai  el-Arbi  and  Mulai 
Mohamed,  were  of  entirely  different  characters. 
The  elder  was  religious  and  timid,  while  his  brother, 
Mulai  Mohamed,  was  a  hunter  and  a  man  of 
courage  and  action,  whose  influence  over  the 
surrounding  wild  mountain  tribes  was  very  great. 
He  did  not  hesitate  to  use  force  when  he  con- 
sidered it  necessary.  During  the  period  of  my 
stay  at  Wazzan  the  town  was  constantly  attacked. 
The  Shereefs  had  organised  a  garrison  for  its 
defence,  consisting  of  their  followers  and  slaves, 
who  were  well  armed  and  well  supplied  with 
ammunition.  Sometimes  these  attacks  were  really 
serious,  though  the  casualties  were  never  very 
great.  On  one  occasion  the  enemy  lost  a  dozen 
killed,  but,  as  far  as  I  know,  this  was  the  largest 
number  of  losses  on  any  one  day. 

I  was  present  on  one  occasion  when  an  attempt 
was  made  to  assassinate  Mulai  Mohamed.  He 
was  seated  in  a  room  which  was  built  over  an 
archway  across  a  street.  Opening  on  to  the  street 
at  either  end  of  this  room  were  two  large  windows. 
The  ground  below  sloped  upwards,  so  that  any 
one  higher  up  the  street  could  see  right  through 
the  room.  It  was  here  that  Mulai  Mohamed 
often  sat,  surrounded  by  particular  friends  and 
retainers.  We  were  there  one  afternoon  drinking 
green  tea,  the  favourite  beverage  of  Morocco, 


276  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

while  a  relation  of  the  Shereefs  was  reading  aloud 
from  an  old  Arabic  manuscript.  Suddenly  the 
glass  of  the  windows  at  both  ends  of  the  room 
was  broken,  and  simultaneously  we  heard  the  re- 
port of  a  rifle.  There  was  a  little  panic  amongst 
the  guests,  but  Mulai  Mohamed,  without  a 
moment's  hesitation,  ordered  his  cousin  to  con- 
tinue the  reading.  The  bullet  had  passed  through 
the  room,  just  missing  the  Shereef.  The  would-be 
assassin  was  never  discovered.  The  shot  had  been 
fired  from  the  upper  end  of  the  street  a  hundred 
yards  or  so  away,  and  no  clue  was  ever  obtained 
as  to  who  fired  it. 

Wazzan  was  the  home  of  tragedy.  Except  for 
the  paramount  influence  of  the  Shereefian  family 
there  was  no  Government  of  any  kind.  The 
Sultans  had  at  various  periods  attempted  to  en- 
force their  jurisdiction,  but  had  never  succeeded. 
Although  ostensibly  on  good  terms  with  the 
Shereefs,  the  jealousy  between  the  reigning  family 
and  Wazzan  was  intense.  The  followers  of  the 
Shereefs,  and  such  tribal  villages  which  were 
counted  as  special  devotees  of  the  "  zaouia," 
paid  no  taxes,  and  were  outside  the  jurisdiction 
of  the  Sultan's  governors.  The  result  was  constant 
friction ;  but  the  Wazzanis'  religious  influence 
was  so  strong,  and  in  such  fear  was  their  name 
held,  that  on  the  whole  the  Shereefs  were  able  to 
set  the  Sultan's  word  at  nought. 

Both  Mulai  el-Arbi  and  Mulai  Mohamed  are 
long  since  dead.  The  elder  brother  was  insane 
for  some  years  before  his  death,  and  the  last  time 


SAINTS,   SHEREEFS,  AND  SINNERS    277 

I  saw  him  his  mind  was  completely  deranged. 
He  was  seated  in  a  chair  in  the  centre  of  a  semi- 
circle of  his  women,  who  were,  of  course,  closely 
veiled,  though  it  was  contrary  to  all  tradition 
that  they  should  be  there  at  all.  Besides  his 
ladies,  the  room  contained  several  live  sheep  and 
a  host  of  fowls,  ducks,  and  pigeons.  He  had 
changed  but  little  in  appearance.  I  noticed  that 
his  retainers,  who  introduced  me,  paid  perhaps 
more  deference  to  the  mad  Shereef  than  they  had 
done  in  the  days  of  his  health ;  but  oriental 
people  have  a  strange  reverence  for  insanity. 
Mulai  el-Arbi  made  no  sign  of  recognition,  and  sat 
immovable.  I  recalled  to  him  the  months  I  had 
spent  as  his  guest  and  incidents  of  my  many 
visits,  but  to  no  avail.  He  listened,  but  made  no 
reply,  though  from  time  to  time  I  noticed  a 
puzzled  look  on  his  face.  I  made  a  move  to  go, 
but  with  his  hand  he  beckoned  me  to  be  seated 
again,  and  once  more  I  continued  trying  to  recall 
the  wandering  memory  of  my  host.  At  last  a 
gleam  stole  into  his  eyes,  and  he  said  very  slowly, 
"  Yes,  and  greyhounds ;  lots  of  greyhounds." 
He  had  remembered ;  for,  hunting  often,  I  had 
kept  quite  a  number  of  native  "  slougis  "  in  the 
days  of  my  stay  at  Wazzan.  It  was  all  he  said. 
He  died  a  few  months  later. 

Some  idea  of  the  sanctity  of  this  man  even  in 
his  own  household  can  be  gathered  from  an  inci- 
dent which  occurred  during  one  of  my  visits.

moned,  and  one  was  accused  by  the  Shereef — it 
must  be  confessed  on  no  evidence — of  having 
stolen  it.  He  was  severely  beaten:  when  I  say 
severely  beaten,  he  received  a  flogging  that  would 
probably  have  killed  a  European.  That  night, 
after  the  Shereef  had  retired  into  his  house,  I 
went  to  see  the  slave,  who,  considering  the  terrible 
punishment  he  had  received,  was  bearing  up  very 
well.  I  asked  him  if  he  was  guilty  of  the  theft. 
His  reply  was  pathetic.  "  I  have  no  recollection 
of  having  stolen  the  teacup,  but  I  must  have  done 
so,  for  my  lord  the  Shereef  has  divine  knowledge, 
and  could  not  have  made  a  mistake."  The  cup 
was  found  and  the  slave  proved  guiltless,  but  he 
received  a  severe  reprimand  for  not  having  been 
able  to  prove  his  innocence  from  the  first. 

Mulai  Mohamed,  the  younger  of  the  two 
brothers,  predeceased  Mulai  el-Arbi.  He  died  of 
a  lingering  and  painful  malady.  He  was  by  far 
the  most  attractive  of  the  two — a  sportsman, 
energetic  and  witty.  I  accompanied  him  on  many 
a  great  hunt  in  the  Wazzan  districts,  when  wild 
boar,  jackals,  hares,  and  partridges  were  slain 
galore — driven  from  their  covert  by  hundreds  of 
tribesmen.  Often  these  hunts  lasted  several  days, 
and  the  evenings  and  nights  were  spent  under 
canvas  in  feasting  and  revelry:  great  days  and 
great  nights  ! 

The  third  brother,  Mulai  Thami,  had  also  a 
tragic  end.  He  had  served  as  a  youth  in  the 
French  Army  in  Algeria,  and  had  learnt  to  read 
and  write  French,  but  he  had  fallen  a  victim  to 


SAINTS,   SHEREEFS,  AND  SINNERS    279 

intemperance.  He  was  a  good  deal  younger  than 
his  two  brothers,  and  the  son  of  another  wife, 
and  considerable  jealousy  existed  between  them. 
He  complained  that  his  share  of  the  revenues  did 
not  reach  him,  and  that  he  was  often  sorely  in 
need  of  money.  When  drunk  he  at  times  became 
very  violent ;  on  other  occasions  he  was  charming, 
an  excellent  conversationalist,  and  he  had  re- 
ceived a  good  education.  Drink  at  length  affected 
his  brain,  and  a  series  of  incidents  led  to  his 
imprisonment.  I  was  at  Wazzan  at  the  time.  In 
a  fit  of  madness  he  fired  from  a  window  of  his 
house  upon  people  passing  to  the  mosque  to 
prayer.  Several  were  killed,  but  his  sanctity 
rendered  him  immune  from  any  punishment.  The 
townspeople  stated  it  was  the  "  Will  of  God," 
manifested  through  the  holy  Shereef,  and  some 
even  envied  the  people  who  had  found  death  at 
his  hands.  All  that  was  done  was  to  post  a  soldier 
in  front  of  his  house  to  warn  the  passers-by  that 
there  was  a  risk  of  being  shot !  The  same  night 
Mulai  Thami  wrote  me  a  letter.  It  is  undated — 
it  was  December  1889 — and  is  written  in  French  : — 

"  MON  CHER  AMI, — Je  vous  prie  de  dire  a  mes

(Translation.) 

"  MY  DEAR  FRIEND, — I  beg  you  to  tell  my 
brothers  that  I  thank  them  very  much  for  having 
sent  still  another  soldier  to  kill  me,  for  to-day  I 
went  up  to  my  couba  (upper  room)  for  a  little 
air.  As  I  looked  out  of  the  window  I  saw  a  soldier 
armed  with  his  rifle.  I  was  afraid,  and  I  aimed 
my  rifle  at  him,  but  as  he  told  me  he  would  do 
nothing  I  let  him  pass  quietly.  He  at  once  went 
to  my  brothers  to  say  that  I  had  wished  to  kill 
him.  I  swear  to  you  on  the  head  of  our  Prophet 
Mohamed  that  if  I  had  wished  to  do  so  I  have 
other  places  from  which  I  could  kill  every  one 
who  passes,  only  I  am  not  mad.  I  killed  those  men 
because  I  was  drunk,  and  also  angry  on  account 
of  a  journey  and  on  account  of  a  story  between 
me  and  a  Shereef.  I  swear  to  you,  my  dear  friend, 
that  I  was  '  off  my  head.' 


SAINTS,   SHEREEFS,  AND  SINNERS    281 

"  Now,  dear  friend,  ask  Mulai  el-Arbi  to  return 
me  my  mule,  and  that  he  send  me  some  money, 
for  my  family  and  I  are  starving. 

"  I  beg  you  to  do  your  utmost  with  my  brothers, 
so  as  to  save  my  life  and  that  of  my  poor  mother. 
The  shot  that  the  solider  fired  missed  me. 

"  Is  it  thus  that  brothers  should  be  ? 

MlTLEY   TOUHAMI." 

He  omitted  to  state  in  this  letter  that  he  had, 
as  well  as  killing  the  people  he  speaks  of,  attempted 
to  murder  the  two  sons  of  his  brother  Mulai 
Mohamed,  by  firing  on  them  inside  the  mosque  ! 

On  Christmas  night,  a  few  weeks  after  these 
incidents,  I  went  to  see  Mulai  Thami,  who  had 
been  sober  and  in  his  right  mind  for  some  time. 
We  were  to  go  hunting  the  next  day  at  dawn, 
and  a  few  details  of  our  excursion  still  remained 
to  be  settled.  I  had  supper  with  him,  but  on  % 
leaving  the  supper-room  in  which  we  had  spent 
the  evening  I  was  treacherously  attacked  by  the 
Shereef  and  his  slaves.  In  the  struggle  I  fell  down 
the  steep  flight  of  stairs.  My  call  for  help  had 
alarmed  some  passers-by,  and  the  Shereef 's  re- 
tainers heard  voices  in  the  street.  They  fled,  and 
their  master  disappeared  into  the  inner  part  of 
the  house.  After  a  short  period  of  unconsciousness 
I  was  able  to  open  the  door  and  get  out  into  the 
street — a  pitiful  figure,  my  clothes  torn  to  rags 
and  stained  with  blood  from  a  wound  on  the  head, 
happily  only  skin-deep,  and  much  bruised. 

Mulai  Thami  was  imprisoned.  After  a  period 
of  incarceration  at  Wazzan  he  was  taken  to  Tangier, 


282  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

but  he  had  become  quite  insane,  and  on  being 
brought  into  the  presence  of  his  father,  Sid  el-Haj 
Abdesalam,  who  still  lived  at  Tangier,  he  wanted 
to  assassinate  him.  He  was  confined  at  Tangier, 
and  some  little  time  later  was  sent  to  a  lunatic 
asylum  in  France,  where  he  lived  for  several  years, 
suffering  from  the  strange  delusion  for  a  Moham- 
medan— that  he  was  Jesus  Christ. 

Wazzan  was  at  this  period  the  most  lawless 
place  in  Morocco.  Many  murders  of  important 
personages  took  place.  The  almost  total  immunity 
of  the  Shereefs  from  punishment — for  it  was  only 
this  head  of  the  family  who  had  the  right  to 
imprison  them,  a  right  dangerous  to  exercise  for 
fear  of  reprisals — increased  crime.  One  instance 
will  be  sufficient  to  demonstrate  the  absolute 
anarchy  which  existed. 

A  Fez  merchant,  who  was  residing  at  Wazzan 
at  this  time,  possessed  a  daughter  who  was  re- 
puted to  be  of  great  beauty.  A  Shereef  asked  the 
father  for  his  daughter's  hand  in  marriage,  and 
was  refused.  The  Fez  merchant  desired  her  to 
marry  a  young  man  of  his  own  native  town,  and 
the  Shereef  in  question  was  quite  undesirable.  In 
time  the  wedding  of  the  young  Fezzi  and  the  girl 
took  place.  It  was  night,  and  the  bridegroom 
rode  at  the  head  of  the  procession,  which  had 
proceeded  to  fetch  the  bride  from  her  father's 
house.  In  the  gaily-decorated  "  Amaria  " — a  sort 
of  box  carried  on  a  mule's  back — was  the  bride, 
surrounded  by  her  relations.  Many  of  the  crowd 
carried  lanterns,  and  the  air  rang  with  the  gay 


SAINTS,   SHEREEFS,  AND  SINNERS    283 

music  of  drums  and  fifes.  Suddenly  the  pro- 
cession was  attacked  by  a  group  of  men  emerg- 
ing from  a  side  street.  It  was  the  disappointed 
Shereef  and  his  retainers.  The  bridegroom  was 
shot,  the  guests  dispersed,  and  the  bride  carried 
off  to  the  house  of  the  Shereef,  who  forthwith 
married  her. 

Wazzan,  surrounded  by  its  gardens  and  olive 
groves,  is  one  of  the  most  picturesque  towns  in 
Morocco.  It  is  situated  on  the  eastern  slopes  of  a 
double-peaked  mountain,  with  an  extensive  view 
over  range  after  range  of  wild  hills  to  the  highlands, 
often  snow-covered,  of  the  Sheshouan  district. 
Snow  often  falls,  and  lies  for  two  or  three  days 
together,  in  Wazzan  itself.  The  result  is  incon- 
venient, for  as  fast  as  it  accumulates  on  the  flat 
roofs  of  the  houses  the  inhabitants  shovel  it  off 
into  the  streets,  which  at  times  are  completely 
blocked.  Situated  on  the  borders  of  the  "  Jibala  "  '' 
— "  mountaineer  " — country  there  is  no  district 
more  turbulent,  and  Wazzan  has  been  for  several 
years  unvisited  by  Europeans.  It  falls  in  the 
French  sphere  of  influence,  and  its  occupation  by 
the  Protectorate  troops  has  lately  been  spoken  of 
as  imminent.1  The  town  has  lost  much  of  its 
religious  prestige.  All  over  Morocco  the  reverence 
for  the  many  Shereefian  families  is  disappearing, 
the  native  finding  that  the  spiritual  return  in 
blessings  is  scarcely  worth  the  financial  sacrifice 
that  is  entailed  to  obtain  them.  In  fact,  the  days 

1  Wazzan  was  occupied  by   the   French    Protectorate   troops   in 
October  1920.

of  the  "  Holy  Shereefs "  are  nearing  an  end, 
though  there  is  still  a  new  role  for  them  to  play 
in  Morocco.  Their  influence,  if  exerted  for  good, 
may  yet  be  very  beneficial  to  the  country,  and 
the  sons  and  grandsons  of  the  English  wife  of  Sid 
el-Haj  Abdesalam  are  setting  a  good  example. 
Her  eldest  grandson,  who  speaks  French  and  Eng- 
lish perfectly,  is  to-day  a  brilliant  young  cadet  of 
the  Protectorate  army  in  the  new  military  school 
for  the  sons  of  "  Nobles  "  at  Meknes.  His  younger 
brothers  are  to  enter  various  professions,  in  which 
they  can  look  for  every  success  in  the  future. 

The  following  sects  are  the  most  influential  and 
numerous  in  Morocco  : — 

Derkaoua. — Followers  of  Mulai  el-Arbi  ben  Ahmed 
el-Derkaoui,  who  was  born  about  1730,  and  is 
buried  in  the  tribe-lands  of  the  Beni  Zerual  tribe, 
in  the  mountains  of  North- West  Morocco,  to  the 
north  of  Fez.  He  was  a  Shereef,  or  descendant  of 
the  Prophet,  and  a  renowned  scholar.  He  him- 
self practised  the  cult  of  the  Chedili  sect,  a  branch 
of  the  better-known  Kaderia,  or  followers  of  Mulai 
Abdul  Kader  el-Ghrailani  of  Baghdad. 

The  order  of  the  "  Derkaoua  "  is  certainly  the 
most  powerful  in  Morocco.  It  is,  as  a  rule,  entirely 
religious,  but  would  be  capable  of  speedy  secret 
organisation  and  combined  political  action.  It 
is  a  "  socialistic  "  and  "  ascetic  "  sect,  depreciat- 
ing all  temporal  rulers,  and  only  accepting  the 
Sultans  of  Morocco  on  the  grounds  of  their  Sher- 
eefian  descent.  They  accentuate  the  great  doc- 
trine of  Islam,  the  Unity  of  God,  and  consider  the 


SAINTS,  SHEREEFS,  AND  SINNERS    285 

Prophet  and  all  other  holy  men  of  secondary 
importance,  though  they  reverence  them.  They 
may  perhaps  best  be  described  as  the  Unitarians 
of  Morocco.  Besides  counting  a  very  large  number 
of  devotees  amongst  the  middle  classes,  the  sect 
boasts  many  professional  adherents,  for  the  most 
part  beggars,  who  can  be  recognised  by  their 
rosaries  of  exaggeratedly  large  beads. 

The  political  influence — at  present  non-existing, 
but  capable  of  almost  instantaneous  appearance, 
should  circumstances  bring  it  to  life — of  this  sect 
is  important.  Exerted  in  the  interests  of  peace 
and  order,  it  might  prove  invaluable  in  a  time  of 
trouble,  for  not  only  is  the  sect  very  numerous, 
but  it  could  also  bring  much  pressure  to  bear  on 
the  people,  and  other  sects.  On  the  contrary, 
should  the  Derkaoua  proclaim  a  campaign  against 
Europeans  and  European  influence,  their  power 
would  be  equally  strong  in  the  interests  of  evil, 
especially  in  stirring  up  other  religious  sects  of 
more  fanatical  tenets,  such  as  the  Aissaoua  and 
Hamacha. 

The  Derkaoua  seem  to  be  the  only  confraternity 
in  Morocco  that  still  maintains  intact  their  secret 
organisation. 

Aissaoua. — Followers  of  Sidi  ben  Aissa.  A  sect 
dating  from  the  seventeenth  century  A.D.  ;  the 
founder  is  buried  at  Mekne"s,  where  the  great  annual 
festival  in  his  honour  is  held,  on  the  Mouloud, 
or  Prophet's  birthday.  The  adherents  of  this  sect 
are  principally  people  of  the  lower  classes.  They 
resemble  more  the  "  dervishes  "  of  the  East  than 


286  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

the  generality  of  the  other  Moroccan  sects,  for 
they  dance,  and  work  themselves  into  a  state  of 
wild  frenzy,  in  which  they  devour  live  sheep,  glass, 
burning  coals,  the  leaves  of  the  "  prickly  pear," 
and  other  equally  indigestible  food.  A  number 
of  fables,  of  little  interest,  are  stated  as  being  the 
origin  of  these  very  unorthodox  proceedings,  which 
are  looked  on  askance  by  the  educated  Moor. 
Sidi  ben  Aissa  is  also  the  patron  saint  of  the  snake- 
charmers. 

Although  when  excited  to  a  state  of  frenzy  the 
"  Aissaoua  "  are  capable  of  acts  of  fanaticism,  they 
are  in  their  ordinary  lives,  as  a  rule,  peaceful  law- 
abiding  people.  There  are  "  zaouias "  of  the 
sect  all  over  Morocco,  presided  over  by  "  Sheikhs  " 
and  "  mokaddems  " ;  but  their  organisation  ap- 
pears to  be  almost  entirely  localised,  and  therefore 
capable  of  no  sudden  political  combination — nor 
need  such  be  looked  for  in  any  case.  There  are  a 
certain  number  of  professional  adherents,  musicians, 
reciters,  snake-charmers,  who  travel  from  town  to 
town,  and  live  on  charity. 

Hamacha. — Followers  of  Sidi  Ali  ben  Hamdouch, 
who  is  buried  on  the  slopes  of  the  Zarhoun  Moun- 
tains, near  Meknes.  Like  the  Aissaoua,  whom  they 
much  resemble,  they  are  principally  people  of  the 
lower  classes.  When  worked  into  a  state  of  religious 
frenzy,  they  cut  their  heads  with  hatchets  and 
throw  up  heavy  cannon-balls  which  they  let  fall 
on  their  skulls.  They  are  capable  of  fanaticism 
when  in  a  frenzical  state,  but  peaceful  citizens  in 


SAINTS,   SHEREEFS,  AND  SINNERS    287 

ordinary  life.  There  are  a  few  professional  Hama- 
cha,  who  perform  in  the  towns  and  country  markets 
for  money. 

Taibiya. — Followers  of  Mulai  Taiyeb,  son  of 
Mulai  Abdullah  Shereef ,  of  Wazzan.  Mulai  Taiyeb 
lived  in  the  early  nineteenth  century,  and  is  buried 
at  Wazzan.  The  adherents  of  this  sect  are,  as  a 
rule,  respectable  middle-class  people.  A  member  of 
this  Shereefian  family  is  always  the  chief  of  this 
order. 

Ulad  Sidi  Ahmed  ou  Mousa. — "  Sons  of  Sidi 
Ahmed  ou  Mousa."  The  patron  saint  of  all  the 
acrobats.  This  Shereef  was  a  descendant  of 
Mulai  Idris,  and  died  early  in  the  thirteenth  cen- 
tury. No  political  importance  of  any  kind. 

Tijania. — Followers  of  Sidi  Ahmed  el-Tijani. 
The  adherents  of  this  sect  are  few  in  Morocco, 
though  strong  in  Algeria.  Essentially  religious. 

Shingata. — Followers  of  the  Shereef  M'al-Ainin 
of  Shingit,  in  the  far  south  of  Morocco.  The  sect 
was  founded  by  this  Shereef,  who  only  died  five 
years  ago.  He  was  of  very  holy  reputation,  and 
was  always  veiled.  The  Sultans  Mulai  Hassen 
and  Mulai  Abdul  Aziz  paid  him  the  greatest 
respect,  and  loaded  him  with  presents  on  his 
periodical  visits  to  the  Court.  On  his  death  he 
was  succeeded  by  his  son,  Mohamed  Hiba,  who 
took  advantage  of  the  disturbed  period  of  1912  to 
declare  himself  Sultan.  He  even  entered  Marra- 
kesh,  the  southern  capital,  but  fled  on  the  approach 
of  the  French  forces. 


288  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

Mohamed  Hiba  was  always  in  revolt,  but  never 
venturing  out  of  the  southern  Sus  districts,  where 
an  expeditionary  force  attacked  him  in  1917, 
defeating  his  followers,  who  were  dispersed.  He 
died  in  1919. 

Kaderia. — Followers  of  Mulai  Abdul  Kader  el- 
Ghrailani,  of  Baghdad,  where  he  is  buried.  This 
"  confraternity "  has  numerous  adherents  in 
Morocco,  which  Mulai  Abdul  Kader  is  supposed 
to  have  visited.  He  died  in  the  twelfth  cen- 
tury A.D. 

It  is  a  strictly  religious  sect,  differing  from 
others  solely  in  the  form  of  prayer  used,  and  in 
the  position  taken  up  when  at  prayer,  and  "  in 
the  absorbing  of  the  individual  in  the  essence  of 
the  Deity  "  by  repetitions  of  the  name  of  God. 
This  sect  shows  more  traces  of  Sufism,  being  of 
Persian  origin,  than  any  other  cult  in  Morocco, 
but  its  original  practices  seem  to  have  become 
adapted  to  Moroccan  thought  and  sentiment.  It 
is  strictly  religious,  and  it  is  difficult  to  say  whether 
it  could  play  any  political  role. 

Nasaria. — Followers  of  Sidi  ben  Nasr,  who  is 
buried  at  Tamgrout,  on  the  Wad  Draa.  An  essen- 
tially religious  and  innocuous  sect. 

Kittamin. — Followers  of  Sidi  Mohamed  el- 
Kittani,  who  was  beaten  to  death  by  order  of 
the  Sultan  Mulai  Hafid  in  1909.  His  martyr- 
dom appears  to  have  given  a  great  impetus  to 
his  followers,  who  are  increasing  in  numbers, 
especially  in  Fez.  A  religious  sect. 

There   are,   in   addition  to    the   "  zaouias "   of 


SAINTS,   SHEREEFS,  AND  SINNERS    289 

the  "  confraternities,"  a  large  number  of  tombs 
which  are  visited  as  places  of  pilgrimage.  It  is 
usual  for  one  day  in  the  year  to  be  set  aside  for 
the  festival  at  each  of  these  tombs,  and  great 
crowds  proceed  to  these  "  mousim."  A  general 
holiday  is  kept  in  the  surrounding  districts,  and 
pilgrims  arrive  from  far  and  near.  Often  if  the 
tomb  is  situated  in  the  country  a  whole  town  of 
tents  springs  up  around  it. 

The  following  is  a  list  of  the  principal  tombs, 
given  in  the  order  of  their  relative  import- 
ance : — 

The  tomb  of  Mulai  Idris  I.,  in  the  mountains  of 
Zarhoun  (died  790  A.D.) 

The  tomb  of  Mulai  Idris  II.,  at  Fez  (died  828(?) 

A.D.) 

The  tomb  of  Mulai  Abdesalam  ben  Mashish 
(died  twelfth  century  A.D.),  in  the  moun- 
tains of  the  Beni  Aros  in  North-West 
Morocco. 

The  tomb  of  Mulai  Brahim  in  the  Ghergaya  dis- 
trict, on  the  northern  slopes  of  the  great 
Atlas,  to  the  south  of  Marrakesh. 

The  tomb  of  Mulai  Ali  Shereef  at  Tafilet)  died 
1590  A.D.) 

The  tomb  of  Mulai  Busseta  el-Khammar  in 
Fichtala,  to  the  north  of  Fez  (twelfth  cen- 
tury A.D.) 

The  tombs  of  Sebat  er-Rejal,  "  the  Seven 
Men"  (i.e.,  the  seven  patron  saints  of 
Marrakesh). 

The  tomb  of  Mulai  Bou  Shaib  at  Azimour. 


290  MOEOCCO  THAT  WAS 

The  tomb  of  Sidi  Ben  Daoud  at  Bu  Jad,  on  the 

plains  of  Central  Morocco. 
The  tomb  of  Mulai  Bouselham,  on  the  sea-shore 

of  the  Gharb  province,  not  far  from  Laraiche. 
The  tomb  and  hot  springs   of   Mulai   Yakoub, 

near  Fez. 


CHANGES  AND   CHANCES 

THE  change  that  is  taking  place,  and  will  still  for 
a  long  time  be  taking  place,  in  Morocco  must  be 
gradual.  The  deep  conservatism  of  the  people — 
the  spirit  that  kept  the  country  closed  for  century 
after  century  to  Europe — has  not  yet  disappeared. 
It  is,  except  in  the  case  of  the  more  remote  tribes, 
less  an  open  opposition  to  reform  than  an  un- 
ceasing disinclination  to  any  alteration  in  their 
status.  In  many  ways  it  is  better  it  should  be  so 
— old  bottles  cannot  stand  too  much  new  wine — 
and  little  by  little  the  Moor  and  the  tribesman 
is  imbibing  the  new  state  of  things  without  appre- 
ciating, or  at  least  without  fully  realising,  the 
great  change  that  is  already  coming  about. 

There  is  no  doubt  that  effectively  it  is  easier 
to  organise  civilisation,  primitive  though  it  may 
at  first  have  to  be,  amongst  the  savage  tribes  of 
Central  Africa  than  to  try  and  adapt,  and  neces- 
sarily to  some  extent  to  destroy,  what  has  pre- 
viously existed.  The  state  of  civilisation  of 
Morocco  has  for  centuries  been  a  high  one  com- 
pared to  most  of  Africa.  It  has  been,  it  is  true,\ 
for  a  long  period  in  its  decadence,  but  none  the 
less  possessing  certain  admirable  features.  The 


292  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

institutions  of  the  country,  the  architecture  and 
art,  the  remnants  of  learning,  the  water-supplies 
of  Fez  and  Marrakesh,  the  manners  of  the  people 
and  their  capacity  as  merchants,  traders,  and 
agriculturists,  all  bespeak  evidences  of  an  attain- 
ment of  civilisation,  uninfluenced  for  many  cen- 
turies past  by  Europe,  that  can  only  be  con- 
sidered as  admirable.  There  has  been  little  or  no 
progress.  The  Moors  lived  on  the  mere  echo  of 
the  past,  but  were  proud  both  of  that  past  and 
of  the  spirit  that  they  had  inherited  from  it — a 
spirit  of  closing  the  door  of  their  country  to  all 
aggression,  and  the  door  of  their  hearts  to  all 
external  influence. 

When  it  does  come — the  beginning  of  the  great 
change,  as  it  has  come  in  Morocco — the  new  system 
must  expect  to  be  met  with  suspicion  and  un- 
popularity. In  course  of  time  the  benefits  will 
be  fully  recognised,  and  some  gratitude  will  be 
shown,  but  it  may  be  a  very  long  time.  Few 
people  in  the  world  really  appreciate  radical  change, 
especially  if  radical  change  is  forced  upon  them  by 
foreigners  in  race,  in  language,  and  in  religion. 
Yet,  on  the  whole,  the  Moor  of  Morocco  is  meeting 
it  in  the  same  stolid  spirit  of  disinterest  as  he 
bore  the  former  persecutions  of  his  own  Sultans 
and  Government.  He  accepts  all  as  the  will  of 
God,  but  finds  that  he  has  now  for  the  first  time 
— I  am  speaking  of  the  French  Protectorate  of 
Morocco — security  of  life  and  property.  He  dislikes 
all  foreigners,  but  he  acknowledges  the  improve- 
ment in  his  situation.  He  is  richer,  happier  than 


CHANGES  AND  CHANCES  293 

he  was.  This  he  puts  down  to  the  merciful  provi- 
dence of  God.  In  return  he  has  to  pay  regular 
taxation,  which  he  particularly  dislikes ;  and 
that  he  puts  down  to  the  intervention  of  the 
French.  He  eases  his  conscience,  and  takes  advan- 
tage of  the  situation. 

Yet  gradual  as  the  change  is,  much  has  already 
been  accomplished.  Only  those  who  knew  the 
country  before  and  who  know  it  now  can  realise 
the  extent  of  what  has  been  done.  When  the 
French  bombarded  Casablanca  and  thus  opened 
the  road  to  their  occupation  of  the  greater  part 
of  Morocco,  they  entered  a  closed  house,  tenanted 
by  suspicion,  fanaticism,  and  distrust.  The  country 
considered  itself  impregnable,  and  the  people 
looked  upon  the  "  Christians "  as  a  despised 
race,  condemned  by  their  religion,  unwarlike  by 
nature,  and  ridiculous  in  appearance.  The  Moor 
imagined  that  with  a  small  Moslem  army,  aided 
by  divine  assistance,  he  could  easily  defeat  all  the 
"  Christian  "  forces  of  the  world.  "  Your  shells 
and  bullets  will  turn  to  water,"  they  said,  "  for 
the  saints  and  holy  men  who  protect  us  will  never 
allow  the  infidel  to  invade  our  land.  Storms  will 
wreck  your  ships,  and  even  should  your  soldiers 
land,  a  handful  of  our  horsemen  would  suffice  to 
drive  them  back  into  the  sea."  They  really 
believed  it. 

What  a  change  has  come  about  since  then — 
and  it  is  only  thirteen  years  ago  that  the  bombard- 
ment of  Casablanca  took  place  !  From  time  to 
time  I  accompanied  the  expedition  that  invaded 


294  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

the  Chaouia  and  the  highlands  beyond  it,  when 
one  by  one  the  tribes  gave  way  and  acknowledged 
that  those  two  French  columns,  advancing  and 
ever  advancing,  were  stronger  than  all  the  saints 
in  their  tombs  and  than  all  the  Holy  Men  with 
their  promises  of  victory.  The  Moor  had  to  realise 
a  fact.  It  was  very  difficult  at  first.  It  changed 
his  whole  aspect  of  life,  his  whole  mentality.  A  few 
thousand  Christians  were  conquering  his  country  ! 
And  the  two  columns  were  as  irresistible  as  the 
fact  itself.  He  took  refuge  in  the  supreme  solace 
of  his  religion — cried,  "It  is  the  will  of  God  "  ; 
laid  his  rifle  aside,  and  either  went  back  to  the 
fields  or  enlisted  in  the  French  Army. 

Behind  the  show  of  force  there  was  another 
and  still  more  important  factor  at  work.  As 
district  after  district  was  occupied  and  the  troops 
passed  on,  there  sprung  up  a  new  organisation,  a 
new  administration  that  safeguarded  the  interests 
of  the  people,  their  lives  and  their  properties. 
They  experienced,  for  the  first  time  for  centuries, 
security.  The  ever-present  fear  of  death,  con- 
fiscation, and  imprisonment,  under  the  shadow  of 
which  they  had  passed  their  whole  lives,  as  had 
their  parents  and  their  ancestors  before  them, 
disappeared.  The  extortion  of  the  "  Kaids " 
ceased,  or  was  greatly  curtailed,  and  justice  was 
obtainable. 

In  the  introduction  of  civilisation  the  French 
have  shown  admirable  tact.  Their  every  act  and 
thought  has  been  influenced  by  a  desire  to  amelio- 
rate the  condition  of  the  people  and  to  render  them 


CHANGES  AND  CHANCES  295 

prosperous.  They  have  built  endless  roads.  They 
have  opened  hospitals  and  dispensaries,  and  every- 
thing has  been  avoided  that  could  wound  the 
religious  susceptibilities  of  the  people.  They 
had  the  experience  of  Algeria  and  Tunis.  They 
studied  our  action  in  Egypt.  They  have 
known  what  to  adopt  and  what  to  avoid.  They 
have  maintained  upon  the  throne  a  descendant 
of  the  ancient  line  of  Sultans,  and,  governing  in 
his  name,  they  have  been  able  to  obtain  an  elas- 
ticity of  administration  which  the  codified  laws 
of  France  could  never  have  given,  had  a  system  of 
direct  government  been  adopted.  They  have  met 
with  far  less  opposition  than  might  have  been 
expected.  In  fact,  the  introduction  of  civilisation 
into  Morocco,  in  times  of  great  difficulty  during 
the  war,  has  been  a  fine  example  of  the  true 
spirit  of  pacification  and  progress.  I,  who  have 
known  Morocco  for  over  thirty  years,  can  bear 
witness  that  in  the  parts  of  the  country  occupied 
by  France  the  improvement  in  the  welfare  of  its 
people  is  immense.  There  is  yet  much  to  be  done. 
Decades  must  pass  before  the  work  is  completed, 
but  I  am  convinced  that  the  great  policy  inaugu- 
rated by  General_Jjyautey  in  Morocco  will  be 
accepted  as  the  basis  of  government— to  the 
mutual  benefit  of  the  "  Protecting "  and  the 
"  Protected." 

Yet  there  are  those  who  still  talk  of  the  "  good 
old  days  "  of  Morocco  before  the  French  came  to 
the  country !  That  any  one  can  regret  that  time 
is  incredible.  Only  those  who  failed  to  see  beneath 


296  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

the  surface — and  how  little  surface  there  was  to 
hide  the  facts — can  possible  compare  the  two 
periods.  The  most  that  can  be  said  against  the 
French  regime  is  that  the  native  finds  the  intro- 
duction of  regulations  annoying.  He  has  regular 
taxes  to  pay  instead  of  suffering  the  extortion  of 
his  own  authorities,  as  he  did  in  the  past.  He  dis- 
likes regularity,  and  some  Moors  would  probably 
prefer  the  uncertainty  and  gambling  chances  of 
the  past  to  the  uneventful  prosperity  of  the 
present.  It  is  true  there  was  the  risk  of  death, 
of  confiscation,  of  imprisonment;  but  there  was  also 
the  chance  of  loot  and  robbery,  of  acquiring  a 
position  by  force  or  by  bribery,  and  of  being  able, 
in  tolerable  security,  to  confiscate  the  property  of 
others  and  put  others  in  prison ;  and  if  in  the 
end  one  died  in  prison  oneself — well,  it  was  God's 
will.  The  Moor  is  a  gambler.  He  staked  under 
that  old  regime  not  only  his  fortune  but  his  life. 
Often  he  lost  both ;  but  sometimes  he  won,  and 
it  was  the  lives  of  others  that  were  sacrificed 
and  their  properties  that  accrued  till  a  great 
estate  was  built  up,  till  palaces  were  built  in  all 
the  capitals,  till  his  slaves  were  legion  and  his 
women  buzzed  like  a  swarm  of  bees — and  then 
one  day  the  end  came.  If  fate  was  kind  he  died 
in  possession  of  his  estates — and  they  were  con- 
fiscated on  the  day  of  his  death;  but  more  often 
he  died  in  prison  while  his  family  starved.  Mean- 
while nothing  could  be  imagined  more  pitiable 
than  was  the  lot  of  the  country  people,  victims  of 
robbery  of  every  kind,  for,  from  the  Sultan  to  the

village  sheikh,  the  whole  Maghzen  pillaged  and 
lived  on  the  poor.  No  man  could  call  his  soul  his 
own.  Thank  God,  the  "  good  old  days  "  are  gone 
and  done  with !  ""\ 

I  sometimes  wonder  whether,  in  spite  of  all  that       \ 
has  been  written  on  the  subject,  the  state  of  affairs         \ 
existing  in  Morocco  up  to  the  date  of  the  intro- 
duction of  the  French  Protectorate  in  1912  is  fully 
realised. 

While  -MulaLJETafid  was  Sultan,  from  1908  to 
1912,  in  which  year  he  abdicated,  the  palace  was 
the  constant  scene  of  barbarity  and  torture.  The 
Sultan  himself,  neurasthenic,  and  addicted,  it  is 
said,  to  drugs,  had  his  good  and  his  bad  days. 
There  was  no  doubt  that  at  first  he  meant  to 
reform  his  country — or  perhaps,  more  correctly, 
to  save  it  from  the  encroaching  intervention  of 
France.  He  was  possessed  of  a  certain  cunning 
intelligence,  and  had  some  idea  of  government, 
but  disappointment  met  him.  Things  had  gone 
too  far.  Morocco  was  doomed.  Finding  all  his 
attempts  to  preserve  his  country's  independence 
futile,  he  gave  way  to  temptations,  and  became 
cruel  and  avaricious. 

Rebels  taken  in  the  war — many,  no  doubt, 
were  harmless  tribesmen — had  their  hands  and 
feet  cut  off.  Twenty-six  were  thus  tortured 
at  Fez  in  one  day.  Twenty-five  succumbed, 
mostly  to  gangrene ;  for  though  the  European 
doctors  in  Fez  implored  the  Sultan  to  be  allowed 
to  attend  them,  Mulai  Hafid  refused.  Publicly 
the  butchers  cut  and  hacked  from  each  of  these 


298  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

unfortunate  men  a  hand  and  a  foot,  treating  the 
stumps  with  pitch.  The  one  survivor  of  that 
particular  batch  is  living  to-day. 

Earlier  in  his  reign — in  1909 — Mulai  Hafid 
became  jealous  of  a  young  Shereef,  Sid  Mohamed 
el-Kittani,  a  member  of  a  great  family,  who, 
having  taken  to  a  religious  life,  had  gathered 
round  him  a  group  of  cultured  men  and  founded 
a  sect.  People  spoke  much  of  him  ;  his  popularity 
and  reputation  were  great.  From  the  precincts 
of  the  palace  the  Sultan  followed  his  every  move- 
ment, and  spies  reported  his  every  word,  but  no 
excuse  could  be  found  for  his  arrest.  But  Mulai 
Hafid  was  determined  that  he  must  be  got  rid  of. 
He  let  the  young  Shereef  understand  that  he  was 
in  danger,  that  the  Sultan  meant  to  arrest  him, 
and,  influenced  by  a  spy,  the  young  man  was  per- 
suaded to  abandon  Fez.  He  fled  by  night — straight 
into  the  trap.  He  was  allowed  to  reach  the  Beni 
Mtir  tribe-lands,  and  there  he  was  arrested.  Mean- 
while the  report  was  spread  that  he  had  tried  to 
get  himself  proclaimed  Sultan,  and  evidence  to 
this  effect  was  easily  produced.  He  was  brought 
back  to  Fez — I  saw  him  brought  a  prisoner  into 
the  palace — and  in  the  presence  of  Mulai  Hafid 
he  was  flogged.  Blow  after  blow  from  knotted 
leathern  cords  was  rained  upon  his  back  and  legs, 
till,  life  almost  extinct,  he  was  carried  away  and 
thrown  into  a  prison  in  the  palace.  He  was  not 
even  allowed  to  have  his  wounds  tended.  He 
lived  for  a  few  days  only,  and  the  slaves  who 
washed  his  dead  body  for  burial  told  me  that  the 


CHANGES  AND  CHANCES  299 

linen  of  his  shirt  had  been  beaten  so  deeply  into 
his  flesh,  which  had  closed  in  hideous  sores  over 
it,  that  they  had  merely  cut  the  more  exposed  parts 
of  the  evil  blood-stained  rags  away  and  left  the  rest. 

Perhaps  the  most  tragic  of  the  tortures  per- 
petrated by  Mulai  Hafid  were  upon  the  family 
of  the  Basha  Haj  ben  Aissa,  the  Governor  of  Fez, 
a  man  whose  reputation  was  certainly  no  worse 
than  that  of  the  majority  of  Moorish  officials,  and 
very  much  better  than  that  of  many. 

Believing  that  he  was  very  rich,  Mulai  Hafid 
had  the  Governor  arrested  and  thrown  into  prison, 
with  several  members  of  his  family.  The  usual 
floggings  and  privations  took  place,  and  Haj  ben 
Aissa  surrendered  all  his  properties  to  the  Sultan. 
But  Mulai  Hafid  was  not  satisfied.  He  believed 
in  the  existence  of  a  great  fortune  in  money. 
As  a  matter  of  fact,  the  Governor  of  Fez  had  been 
a  keen  agriculturist,  and  had  invested  all  his 
gains — licit  and  illicit — in  land,  but  nothing  could 
persuade  the  Sultan  that  this  was  the  fact.  He 
gave  orders  that  the  fortune  was  to  be  found  ;  and 
thus  fresh  privations  and  more  floggings  ensued, 
but  all  to  no  avail.  Then  the  women  were 
arrested,  amongst  them  the  aristocratic  wife  of  the 
Governor  of  Fez,  a  lady  of  good  family  and  high 
position.  It  was  thought  that  she  would  know, 
and  disclose  the  hidden  treasure.  She  was  tor- 
tured, but  disclosed  nothing,  because  there  was 
nothing  to  disclose. 

The  whole  of  this  story  came  to  my  knowledge, 
and  the  barbarity  of  the  Sultan's  proceedings 


I 


300  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

determined  me  to  let  the  world  know  what  was 
passing.  The  '  Times '  opened  its  columns  un- 
reservedly to  these  wrongs,  as  that  great  paper 
has  never  failed  to  do  whenever  there  has  been  a 
wrong  to  redress.  It  was  not  so  much  the  tortur- 
ing of  the  wife  of  the  Governor  of  Fez — terrible 
though  that  was — as  the  fact  that  these  things 
were  still  happening  in  Morocco — and  must  cease. 
The  evidence  I  had  was  legally  slight,  but  I  deter- 
mined to  see  it  through.  The  Sultan  denied, 
threatened,  and  denied  again,  but  the  repeated 
efforts  of  the  '  Times  '  were  sufficient  even  to  move 
the  Foreign  Office,  and  it  was  decided  that  some 
action  must  be  taken.  The  late  Sir  Reginald 
Lister  was  British  Minister  at  that  time,  and  his 
encouragement  and  help  assisted  me  in  my  cam- 
paign. At  long  length  the  British  Government 
decided  to  ask  the  Sultan  to  produce  the  lady, 
as  no  other  proof  would  be  sufficient  to  persuade 
them  that  great  cruelties  had  not  been  perpetrated. 
The  French  Government  stood  side  by  side  with 
our  own  in  the  interests  of  humanity.  The  Sultan 
agreed  willingly,  but  failed  to  produce  the  lady. 
The  energy  of  Mr  McLeod,  the  British  Consul  at 
Fez,  was  untiring.  He  was  determined  to  see  the 
matter  through.  At  length,  driven  by  the  force 
of  circumstances,  the  Sultan  allowed  the  Basha's 
wife  to  be  visited  by  two  English  lady  medical 
missionaries,  accompanied  by  the  wife  of  a  French 
doctor.  They  saw  her  in  the  recesses  of  the  palace, 
and,  in  spite  of  protestations  and  threats  on  the 
part  of  the  slaves,  they  insisted  on  examining  her. 


CHANGES  AND  CHANCES  301 

Her  crippled  body,  and  the  terrible  scars  of  recent 
wounds,  amply  justified  the  '  Times '  action.  The 
Sultan  had  lied  throughout.  The  woman  had 
been  cruelly  tortured. 

With  that  humane  spirit  which  he  has  shown 
throughout  his  whole  life,  Sid  el  Haj  Mohamed  ^ 
el-Mokri,  who  was  Grand  Vizier  then,  and  to-day 
so  ably  fills  the  same  post,  took  the  injured  wife 
of  the  Governor  of  Fez  into  his  own  house,  where 
she  received  all  the  medical  assistance  of  which 
she  stood  in  need,  and  all  the  kindness  of  the 
vizier's  womenkind. 

I  have  two  letters  referring  to  this  incident 
which  I  value.  One  is  from  Mr  J.  M.  McLeod, 
C.M.G.,  then  British  Consul  at  Fez,  dated  28th  July 
1910,  in  which  he  writes  to  me  to  tell  me  that  the 
surviving  members  of  Haj  Ben  Aissa's  family  had 
been  to  see  him  for  the  purpose  of  asking  him  to 
let  me  know  how  grateful  they  were  for  the  "  great 
efforts  I  had  made  on  their  behalf,  which  had  been 
an  immense  solace  to  them."  The  second  is  a 
letter  from  the  British  Minister,  Sir  Reginald 
Lister,  dated  22nd  February,  from  the  Dolomites, 
in  which  he  says,  "  I  write  first  and  above  all  to 
congratulate  you  on  your  triumph  in  the  matter 
of  the  tortures."  After  all,  my  part  had  been 
small.  It  was  the  publicity  that  the  '  Times ' 
gave  to  my  telegrams  and  messages  that  obtained 
the  success.  Two  years  afterwards,  when  circum- 
stances had  brought  Mulai  Hafid  and  myself 
together  again,  I  asked  him  to  explain  his  action. 
He  told  me  that  he  knew  the  woman  had  been 


302  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

tortured — she  was  not  the  only  one — but  that  he 
personally  had  not  intended  it.  He  said  that  when 
he  had  been  informed  that  Haj  ben  Aissa's  fortune 
could  not  be  found,  he  had  ordered  the  arrest  of 
his  womenkind.  A  little  later  he  was  told  the 
women  "  wouldn't  speak,"  and  he  acknowledged 
that  he  had  replied,  "  They  must  be  made  to  speak." 
Such  words  from  such  a  source  were  taken  to  mean 
one  thing,  and  one  thing  alone — torture  ;  and  they 
were  tortured. 

Of  the  end  of  Bou  Hamara  I  have  written  else- 
where: his  long  confinement  in  a  small  cage,  his 
being  thrown  to  the  lions  in  the  presence  of  the 
Sultan's  women,  and  eventually  his  being  shot 
after  the  savage  beasts  had  mangled  and  torn  his 
arms. 

Those  were  the  "  good  old  days  "  ! 

It  was  not  only  in  the  palace  that  there  was 
cruelty.  In  every  governor's  Kasba,  deep  in 
damp  dungeons — as  often  as  not  holes  scooped 
in  the  earth  for  storing  grain — there  lay  and  pined 
those  who  had  committed,  or  not  committed,  as 
the  case  might  be,  some  crime ;  and  still  more 
often,  those  who  were  rich  enough  to  be  squeezed. 
In  such  suffering,  and  in  darkness,  receiving  just 
sufficient  nourishment  to  support  life,  men  were 
known  to  have  existed  for  years,  to  emerge  again 
long  after  their  relations  had  given  up  all  hope  of 
seeing  them.  But  there  was  always  a  chance — 
a  chance  that  the  Governor  might  die  or  fall  into 
disgrace ;  and  then  the  dungeons  in  his  castle 
would  be  opened  and  the  wrecks  of  his  prisoners 


CHANGES  AND  CHANCES  303 

be  released.  And  what  prisons !  what  horrors  of 
prisons  they  were,  even  those  above  ground  and 
reserved  for  the  ordinary  class  of  criminal.  Chained 
neck  to  neck,  with  heavy  shackles  on  their  legs, 
they  sat  or  lay  in  filth,  and  often  the  cruel  iron 
collars  were  only  undone  to  take  away  a  corpse. 
The  prisons  in  the  towns  were  bad  enough,  but 
those  of  the  country  Kasbas  were  far  worse. 
Mulai  Abdul  Aziz,  who  reigned  from  1894  till 
1908,  and  who  still  lives  at  Tangier,  deserves  at 
least  some  credit,  for  at  one  period  of  his  reign  he 
put  the  prisons  of  Fez  in  order.  They  were  largely 
restored,  a  water-supply  was  added,  and  they 
became  less  hideous  than  they  had  been  before; 
but  gradually  the  old  system  crept  back  again, 
and  the  improvements  lasted  only  a  little  while. 
With  all  the  good  intentions  in  the  world,  a  Sultan 
of  those  days  could  not  break  down  the  traditions 
and  corruption  of  his  surroundings. 

Amongst  the  great  Berber  chieftains  of  the 
Atlas,  lif e  was  even  harder ;  but  at  all  events  there 
was  not  the  same  persecution  and  squeezing  as 
existed  in  the  plains  and  richer  districts.  The 
more  than  semi-independence  of  the  Berbers  freed 
them  from  the  perpetual  exactions  of  the  Maghzen, 
though  by  no  means  from  the  extortion  of  their 
own  chiefs.  Yet  the  very  climate,  the  hardships 
of  life  in  those  inhospitable  peaks,  the  constant 
warfare  in  which  the  tribes  were  engaged  with  one 
another,  made  men  of  them,  and  all  the  traditions 
of  their  race  were  democratic.  But  if  the  same 
oppression  for  the  sake  of  extorting  money  did  not 


304  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

exist,  their  treatment  of  prisoners  taken  in  war 
whose  lives  were  not  forfeited,  or  of  those  held  as 
hostages,  was  harsh  enough.  They,  too,  the  great 
Berber  Kaids,  had  their  castles  and  their  dungeons, 
and  the  latter  were  seldom  empty.  The  whole  life 
in  those  great  Atlas  fortified  Kasbas  was  one  of 
warfare  and  of  gloom.  Every  tribe  had  its  enemies, 
every  family  had  its  blood-feuds,  and  every  man 
his  would-be  murderer.  Since  quite  my  early 
years  in  Morocco  I  have  visited  these  far-away 
castles,  and  with  many  of  the  Berber  Kaids  I 
enjoy  to-day  a  friendship  that  has  lasted  over 
many  years.  With  the  family  of  the  Kaids  of 
Glaoua  I  have  long  been  on  intimate  terms.  When 
I  first  knew  them,  Sid  Madani  Glaoui  was  merely 
the  Governor  of  the  Glaoua  tribe,  and  his  younger 
brother,  Sid  Thami — a  youth  then — held  no  official 
position.  Remarkable  for  their  skill  in  warfare 
and  for  their  ability  in  tribal  diplomacy,  the 
members  of  the  Glaoua  family  seldom  left  the 
high  mountain  peaks,  except  to  pay  periodical 
visits  to  Marrakesh,  three  days'  journey  from  their 
home.  Their  Kasba  at  Teluet,  the  grandest  of  all 
the  Atlas  fortresses,  is  situated  over  7000  feet 
above  the  level  of  the  sea.  Such  ability  did  these 
young  brothers  possess,  that  it  was  not  difficult 
to  foresee  that  they  must  be  destined  to  play  a  role 
in  the  history  of  Morocco.  They  began  by  consoli- 
dating their  power  in  the  Atlas,  both  by  diplo- 
macy and  by  a  series  of  little  wars,  in  which  they 
surpassed  themselves  in  feats  of  arms,  and  in  which 
both  were  repeatedly  wounded.  As  Commander- 


CHANGES  AND  CHANCES  305 

in-Chief  of  the   Shereefian  forces  the  elder  was 
employed  by  Mulai  Abdul  Aziz  in  his  wars  against 
the  Rif  tribes.     Meanwhile  the  Glaoua  faction  in 
the  south  was  becoming  all-powerful,  and  when 
Mulai  Hafid  in  1908  unfurled  the  standard  of  revolt 
against  his  brother,  the  Glaoui  chiefs  supported 
him.     Without  them  his  cause  must  have  failed 
at  once.     Madani  became  his  Minister  of  War  and 
later  his  Grand  Vizier ;    his  brother,  Haj  Thami, 
was   appointed  Governor  of  Marrakesh  and  the 
surrounding  tribes.     Capable  in  the  art  of  native 
government,    they   were   equally   capable   in   the 
management  of  their  own  affairs.     Their  estates, 
the  most  extensive  of  any  except,  perhaps,  the 
Sultan's    Maghzen    properties,     were     admirably 
worked  and  conducted,  and  vast  revenues  flowed 
in.    At  the  moment  when  the  French  Protectorate 
was  declared,  both  these  able  men  threw  in  their 
lot   with   France,    and   have   served   her   loyally. 
Intelligent,  realising  for  years  past  that  the  end 
of  the  independence  of  Morocco  might  be  staved 
off  for  a  short  period,  but  was  eventually  inevitable, 
the    Glaoui    brothers    had   never    disguised   their 
preference   for   reform    and   their   desire   for   the 
opening  up  of  Morocco's  wealth.     The  Berber  race 
possesses   not   only   a   keenness   of   intellect,   but 
also  an  activity  that  is  wanting  in  the  other  in- 
habitants of  Morocco.    Roads,  railways,  machinery 
pleases  them,  and  they  are  eager  for  their  intro- 
duction.    Their  mentality  is   European  and  not 
African.

was  really  regretted,  not  only  by  the  French,  to 
whom  he  rendered  great  services,  but  also  by  the 
natives.  He  was  one  of  the  greatest,  the  richest, 
and  the  most  generous  of  Berber  chiefs,  a  man  of 
delightful  manners  and  much  learning.  His  brother, 
Haj  Thami,  still  a  comparatively  young  man,  is 
to-day  Basha  of  Marrakesh.  He  lives  a  simple  life 
in  the  midst  of  much  splendour,  and  spends  all 
the  hours  that  he  can  spare  from  his  official  duties 
hi  visiting  his  estates  or  in  handling  and  reading 
his  wonderful  collection  of  Arabic  manuscripts. 
On  one  of  my  visits  to  their  Kasba  at  Teluet,  I 
think  in  the  year  1901,  I  allowed  myself  to  be 
persuaded  to  stay  on  and  on,  though  I  ought 
already  to  have  been  on  my  way  toward  the  coast. 
First  it  had  been  Kaid  Madani  who  had  asked  me 
to  remain  another  day,  then  one  or  other  of  his 
brothers  or  cousins,  and  so  on.  Every  morning  I 
prepared  to  start,  and  every  time  I  was  begged 
to  stay.  At  last  I  really  expected  to  be  allowed 
to  leave,  but  I  was  led  out  into  a  great  court- 
yard, overlooked  by  the  frowning  walls  of  the 
Kasba.  On  the  terraced  roofs  were  gathered  a 
multitude  of  veiled  women.  My  host,  bidding  me 
look  up,  said,  "  To-day  it  is  our  womenfolk  who 
beg  you  to  stay,"  and  with  a  loud  cry  the  women 
uttered  their  welcome.  The  Berbers  are  less  strict 
about  womenkind,  and  I  often  conversed  with 
elderly  ladies  of  the  Glaoua  family.  On  asking 
one  of  these  personages — she  was  a  very  near 
relation  to  Sid  Madani — why  it  was  the  women 
of  the  Kasba  desired  me  to  prolong  my  stay,  she 


CHANGES  AND  CHANCES  307 

replied,  "  Because  since  you  have  been  here  there 
has  been  a  truce  to  war  and  to  feud.  Our  sons 
and  our  sons'  sons  are  in  safety.  Before  you  came 
no  one  ever  laughed  in  the  Kasba,  for  the  men 
think  only  of  war,  and  we  women  only  of  death ; 
but  for  a  fortnight  now  we  have  laughed  and  sung, 
having  no  fear.  But  when  you  go  the  truce  will 
end,  and  all  our  laughter  will  cease."  It  made 
one  realise  life  in  the  Kasba  of  Teluet. 

When  Sid  Madani  Glaoui  was  at  Fez  as  Grand 
Vizier  during  the  reign  of  Mulai  Hafid,  he  had 
only  a  few  of  his  very  numerous  children  with 
him.  Amongst  these  few  was  a  favourite  son  by 
a  black  slave  woman.  He  was  about  twelve  years 
of  age,  very  dark,  but  of  a  remarkable  vivacity 
and  intelligence,  and  most  amusing.  Unfortu- 
nately this  temperament  had  its  disadvantages, 
and  his  conduct  for  his  age  was  disgraceful.  He 
had  already  indulged  in  the  wildest  life.  His 
father  had  sent  him  to  the  French  school,  but  it 
was  only  on  the  rarest  occasions  that  he  ever 
turned  up  there.  No  matter  how  many  of  the 
Vizier's  retainers  took  him  to  the  door,  he  invari- 
ably by  some  means  or  other  escaped,  and  spent 
his  days  in  far  less  eligible  society  elsewhere.  At 
last  things  became  so  bad  that  the  schoolmaster 
insisted  on  complaining  personally  to  his  father. 
The  boy  was  summoned  into  his  presence,  and  was 
asked  why  he  played  truant.  He  denied  it,  to  the 
surprise  of  both.  He  insisted  that  he  attended 
school  regularly,  and  that  it  was  only  because 
the  schoolmaster  disliked  him  that  this  accusation 


308  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

was  made  against  him.  The  schoolmaster  continued 
naturally  to  contradict  the  boy,  who  at  last  said, 
"  Well,  I  can  prove  it.  If  I  hadn't  attended  school 
I  couldn't  speak  French.  Examine  me."  Hur- 
riedly one  of  the  Vizier's  Algerian  retinue  was 
called  and  asked  to  address  the  boy  in  French. 
He  did  so,  and  the  black  imp  replied  with  the 
facility  almost  of  a  Parisian,  but  it  wasn't  the 
French  that  schoolboys  ought  to  learn.  The  ex- 
pressions and  words  he  used  made  the  school- 
master's hair  stand  on  end,  but  undoubtedly  he 
spoke  French,  and  with  a  fluency  that  was  appal- 
ling. It  was  not  in  a  school  for  the  "  sons  of 
gentlemen "  that  he  had  learned  it — nor  in  a 
school  for  the  "  daughters  of  ladies  "  either — but 
in  a  French  cafe  chantant,  as  it  called  itself,  which 
had  recently  been  installed  in  the  Jews'  quarter  of 
the  city. 

The  Jews  of  Morocco  are  a  race  apart.  There 
are  two  distinct  branches — the  descendants  of  the 
original  Berber  Jews  of  the  country,  and  the 
descendants  of  the  Jews  who  migrated  from  Spain, 
mostly  in  the  fifteenth  century.  While  the  latter 
have  preserved  Spanish  as  their  native  tongue, 
the  former  use  the  Shelha  (Berber)  or  Arabic 
languages,  according  to  the  part  of  Morocco  they 
inhabit.  The  type,  as  might  be  expected,  is  very 
different,  and  it  is  often  difficult,  and  at  times 
impossible,  to  distinguish  between  the  Israelites 
of  the  Atlas  and  the  neighbouring  Moselm  Berber 
tribesmen.  They  even  dress  alike,  except  for  the 
small  black  cap  which  is  common  to  the  Jewish 


CHANGES  AND  CHANCES  309 

tribes.  The  origin  of  these  indigenous  Jews  is 
unknown,  but  their  presence  in  Morocco  is  of 
great  antiquity.  A  tradition  exists  that  they  were 
driven  out  of  Palestine  by  Joshua,  the  son  of 
Nun,  but  it  seems  more  probable  that  they  were 
native  Berbers  converted  at  some  very  early 
period  from  paganism. 

These  original  Jews  inhabit  the  interior  of  the 
country,  mostly  in  the  towns,  though  many  are 
scattered  amongst  the  tribes.  They  live  alone, 
and  regard  the  more  educated  Jews  of  Spanish 
origin  as  leaning  toward  unorthodoxy,  if  not 
actually  unorthodox.  The  circumstances  in  which 
they  pass  their  existence  amongst  proud  and 
fanatical  Moslem  tribesmen  has  naturally  given 
to  the  native  Jews  none  of  the  facilities  nor  the 
incentives  for  progress.  In  the  case  of  the  Jews 
of  Spanish  descent  there  has  been  a  remarkable 
movement  during  the  last  fifty  years.  They  have 
seized  upon  every  form  and  kind  of  education  in 
order  to  increase  their  social  welfare.  Schools 
have  been  built,  professors  from  Europe  engaged, 
and  all  this  has  been  accomplished  almost  entirely 
from  funds  locally  subscribed.  The  "  Alliance 
Israelite  "  has  largely  found  the  personnel  of  the 
schools,  but  the  wave  of  education  has  been  the 
work  of  the  intelligent  Jews  themselves.  No  sacri- 
fice has  been  too  great,  no  effort  too  vast,  with 
the  result  to-day  that  there  is  scarcely  a  Jew  in 
the  coast  towns  of  Morocco  who  does  not  speak 
and  read  and  write  at  least  two  languages,  while 
the  majority  speak  three.  These  Jews  of  Spanish 


310  MOEOCCO  THAT  WAS 

origin  share  with  their  co-religionists  of  the  East 
the  title  of  "  Sephardim."  When  they  were  exiled, 
after  a  period  of  cruel  persecution,  from  Spain, 
they  sought  refuge  in  Morocco.  They  were  already 
an  educated  and  civilised  race,  in  learning  and  the 
arts  far  ahead  of  the  majority  of  Spaniards, 
amongst  whom  they  were  no  longer  permitted  to 
live.  On  their  arrival  in  Morocco  they  found  the 
Jews  of  Berber  origin  living  in  a  position  of  in- 
feriority, such  as  it  would  be  quite  impossible  for 
them  to  accept.  They  therefore  negotiated  with 
the  Sultan  an  "  Ordonnance  "  as  to  the  status  they 
might  hold  in  the  country,  which  at  the  same 
time  laid  down  certain  rules  for  the  guidance  of 
then1  own  conduct,  lest  life  amongst  their  more 
ignorant  native  co-religionists  might  cause  them 
to  abandon  some  of  their  more  civilised  and 
civilising  tenets.  This  "  Ordonnance  "  is  still  ad- 
hered to,  and  is  known  to  the  "  Sephardim  "  as  the 
"  Decanot."  It  contains,  amongst  many  other 
clauses,  rules  as  to  marriage  contracts,  and  on  the 
question  of  succession  of  property. 

The  "  Sephardim  "  of  Morocco  are  a  remarkable 
people,  who  have  rendered  and  are  rendering  great 
services  to  the  country.  Hard-working,  intelligent, 
keen  business  men,  and  capable  organisers,  the 
Spanish  Jews  of  Morocco  have  progressed  in 
civilisation,  in  education,  and  in  fortune  in  a 
manner  that  is  highly  commendable. 

But  long  before  this  modern  "  renaissance," 
the  "  Sephardim  "  Jews  of  Morocco,  in  spite  of 
the  great  difficulties  and  drawbacks  under  which 


CHANGES  AND  CHANCES  311 

they  existed,  had  gained  for  themselves  a  position 
in  Morocco.  They  had  become,  as  bankers  and 
money-lenders,  indispensable  to  the  country,  while 
they  filled  also  many  other  professions.  The 
tailors,  jewellers,  tent-makers,  and  metal-workers 
were  practically  all  Jews.  The  "  Mellah,"  as  their 
quarter  is  called,  was  the  centre  of  trade.  In 
their  shops  there  was  nothing  too  small  to  be 
bought :  I  have  seen  boxes  of  wax-matches  split 
up  and  sold  by  the  half-dozen;  while  the  same 
shopman,  or  perhaps  his  brother,  would  lead  you 
to  his  house,  and  in  an  upper  chamber,  with  the 
door  locked,  offer  you  a  string  of  pearls  or  a  great 
cabuchon  emerald,  or  a  diamond  the  size  of  a 
shilling. 

In  many  ways  their  position,  persecuted  though 
they  were  as  a  race,  was  preferable  to  that  of  the 
Moslem.  They  had  their  own  laws,  administered 
by  their  rabbis.  Their  taxation  was  collected 
apart  by  their  own  people,  and  paid  in  a  sort  of 
offering  to  the  Sultan.  They  were  squeezed,  of 
course,  and  now  and  again  their  quarter  was 
pillaged,  but  there  was  never  the  individual 
danger  of  persecution  such  as  the  Moslem  was  at 
all  times  liable  to.  They  were  able  almost  at  any 
time  to  gain  access  to  the  authorities,  and  even 
to  the  Sultans,  who  in  their  conversation  with  the 
many  Jews  and  Jewesses  who  worked — as  tent- 
makers  and  tailors — in  the  palace,  were  far  more 
intimate  and  affable  than  with  their  own  people. 
Both  Mulai  Abdul  Aziz  and  Mulai  Hafid  had

Jews,  with  whom  they  were  on  terms  of  consider- 
able intimacy.  The  result  was  that  the  Jews  of 
Morocco  as  a  race  were  far  more  often  able,  through 
their  friendships  at  Court  and  with  the  viziers, 
to  obtain  justice  for  their  wrongs  than  were  their 
Moslem  neighbours,  and  even  in  the  country 
districts  a  Jewish  trader  was  feared.  He  would 
be  mocked  at  perhaps,  or  sometimes  a  little 
bullied,  but  seldom  really  ill-treated.  An  example 
of  the  fear  in  which  the  Jews  were  held  came  to 
my  personal  knowledge  during  my  travels  many 
'  years  ago.  A  Jew,  travelling  alone  from  country 
market  to  country  market,  was  murdered,  and 
his  little  stock-in-trade  and  his  few  dollars  were 
robbed.  The  murder  took  place  in  the  thickly- 
populated  Gharb  district,  between  two  of  the 
most  important  markets,  during  the  early  hours 
of  the  night.  I  knew  the  man  well,  and  he  was  a 
constant  visitor  of  the  "  souks."  For  a  day  or 
two  nothing  was  known,  except  that  he  was  no 
longer  seen  at  the  markets.  He  might,  it  is  true, 
have  gone  back  to  Alcazar,  his  native  town,  to 
replenish  his  stock,  but  it  seemed  certain  know- 
ledge that  he  had  been  done  to  death.  His  body, 
however,  was  not  found,  though  on  those  level 
plains,  thick  with  tent  and  hut  villages,  it  would 
be  difficult  to  hide  it.  All  that  could  be  said  for 
certain  was  that  he  had  disappeared. 

Now,  what  had  happened  was  this.  The  mur- 
derers, having  robbed  the  body,  laid  it  by  night 
just  outside  a  neighbouring  village.  At  dawn  the 
villagers  found  it,  and  terrified  of  being  accused  of 


CHANGES  AND  CHANCES  313 

murdering  a  Jew,  they  concealed  the  corpse  till 
night,  when  stealthily  they  carried  it  away  and 
laid  it  on  the  outskirts  of  another  village.  Here 
again  the  same  manoeuvre  was  practised,  and  day 
by  day  and  night  by  night  the  body  was  con- 
cealed and  carried  on.  It  mattered  little  that  in 
time  the  state  of  the  corpse  would  have  clearly 
demonstrated  that  the  murder  had  taken  place 
already  some  time  back.  It  would  have  been 
sufficient  evidence  of  guilt  merely  for  it  to  have 
been  found  near  a  village,  no  matter  how  decom- 
posed. The  inevitable  punishment  would  have 
been  severe — imprisonments  and  confiscations — 
for  the  innocent  villagers.  Had  the  murdered  man 
been  a  Moslem,  little  heed  would  have  been  taken, 
but  the  murder  of  a  Jew  was  far  more  serious. 
The  matter  reached  my  ears,  for  the  inhabitants 
of  a  village  confided  in  me  that  they  had  found 
the  body  that  morning,  and  that,  owing  to  death 
having  occurred  some  weeks  before,  its  transport 
to  another  village  was  a  matter  of  extreme  diffi- 
culty. I  intervened,  and  notified  the  discovery  to 
the  authorities,  and  the  villagers  did  not  suffer. 

The  business  instinct  is  naturally  very  strong 
amongst  the  Morocco  Jews.  Their  existence  has 
always  been  a  struggle  in  the  past,  and  life  has 
been  hard.  One  of  the  many  friends  I  have 
amongst  the  race  told,  with  a  delightful  sense  of 
humour,  an  anecdote  of  his  early  childhood.  He 
had  just  begun  to  study  in  Hebrew  the  details  of 
his  faith,  and  his  soul  was  aflame  with  the  idea 
that  the  promised  Messiah  might  come  at  any 


314  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

moment.  Bidding  good  night  to  his  parents  and 
his  relatives,  he  whispered  to  his  old  grandmother, 
a  lady  of  great  influence  in  the  family,  "  Do  you 
think  the  Messiah  will  come  to-night  ? "  She 
patted  his  head  gently,  and  said,  "  Don't  worry, 
my  dear,  about  that.  He  will  come  in  his  own 
day.  Learn  to  add  up ;  learn  to  add  up."  She 
was  a  practical  old  lady,  and  her  grandson  followed 
her  advice.  He  is  to-day  the  leader  of  the  Jewish 
community  in  one  of  the  most  important  towns  in 
Morocco,  an  honourable  and  wealthy  man,  of  great 
generosity,  and  of  unswerving  devotion  to  the 
interests  of  his  people. 

The  Jews  keep  very  strictly  to  the  letter  of  the 
law,  and  though  I  have  every  respect  for  devotion, 
I  once  was  really  very  seriously  annoyed  by  the 
rigid  adherence  of  an  elderly  Israelite  to  his 
commandments. 

I  was  camping  in  the  Gharb  province  in  winter. 
The  rain  was  falling  in  torrents,  and  the  ground 
deep  in  mud.  During  dinner  a  Jewish  youth 
arrived,  and,  bursting  into  my  tent,  began  to 
cry.  As  soon  as  he  could  make  himself  intelligible, 
he  stated  that  his  father,  who  was  camping  in  a 
neighbouring  village,  was  very  ill.  He  had  heard 
of  the  arrival  of  a  "  Christian,"  and  begged  me  to 
go  and  see  him.  I  went,  my  men  accompanying 
me  with  lanterns.  It  was  a  long  walk,  and  it  was 
raining  cats  and  dogs ;  but  at  length  we  arrived 
where  the  camp  of  the  Jews  was  pitched — a 
couple  of  big  tents,  such  as  the  travelling  Jewish 
trader  always  uses.  Everything  was  in  darkness. 


CHANGES  AND  CHANCES  315 

If  was  welcomed,  by  the  light  of  my  own  lanterns, 
by  the  youth's  father,  who,  surrounded  by  his 
bales  of  cloth  and  cotton  goods,  seemed  the  picture 
of  health.  After  the  usual  compliments  I  asked 
what  I  could  do. 

It  was  Friday  night,  and  therefore  the  Jews 
had  already  entered  upon  their  Sabbath.  With 
many  apologies,  the  merchant  informed  me  that 
the  wind  had  put  their  lanterns  out,  and  as  it  was 
the  Sabbath  they  were  not  permitted  to  strike 
matches,  so  they  could  not  relight  them.  The 
Moors — infidels,  he  called  them — had  refused  to 
help  them,  and  so  he  had  been  obliged  to  trouble 
me  ! — and  I  had  walked  a  couple  of  miles  through 
deep  mud,  late  at  night,  in  torrents  of  rain — to 
strike  a  match  ! 

I  struck  it,  and  I  pride  myself  it  was  the  only 
thing  I  did  strike.  I  left  him  with  his  lanterns 
alight,  but  I  made  him  tip  my  men  so  generously 
for  their  long  and  tiring  walk,  that  he  would  pro- 
bably prefer  in  the  future  to  spend  weeks  in  dark- 
ness rather  than  risk  disturbing  another  Christian. 

A  Moslem  family  that  suffered  many  vicissi- 
tudes was  that  of  a  former  Governor  of  Oulad 
Sifian  in  the  Gharb.  Haj  Bouselham  er-Remoush 
was  at  one  time  a  great  man.  He  owed  his  ap- 
pointment to  friends  and  to  bribery  at  Court,  and 
quickly  became  an  influential  and  wealthy  per- 
sonage. As  a  matter  of  fact,  he  was  not,  as 
Moorish  Raids  go,  a  bad  Governor.  Extortion  he 
naturally  practised,  and  his  prisons  were  full,  but 
the  tribe  he  governed  did  not  inordinately  com- 


316  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

plain,  which  meant  that  he  must  have  had  some 
good  points.  Those  good  points  certainly  weren't 
his  sons.  The  elder,  who  was  deputy-Governor, 
was  a  thorough  rascal.  A  fine  horseman,  always 
beautifully  dressed,  he  was  to  outward  appearances 
an  attractive  personality ;  but  he  drank  copiously, 
and  no  good-looking  woman  or  girl  in  his  juris- 
diction was  safe  from  his  attentions.  He  was  still 
almost  a  youth  when  the  crash  came.  There  had 
been  complaints  to  the  Sultan  of  his  licentiousness, 
and  consequently  the  father  was  heavily  "squeezed" 
from  Court,  and  his  fortune  could  not  stand  the 
pressure.  When  the  viziers  had  extracted  all  he 
had  to  give,  a  band  of  troops  arrived,  and  arrested 
all  the  male  members  of  the  family,  while  the 
soldiers  spent  the  following  day  or  two  in  his 
harem.  His  house  was  torn  down  stone  by  stone 
in  the  search  for  treasure,  and  the  Kaid  and  his 
two  elder  sons  were  sent  in  chains  to  Marrakesh. 
His  home  became  a  ruin,  and  his  gardens  were 
destroyed.  Still  to-day,  in  the  midst  of  a  tangle 
of  "  prickly  pear,"  one  sees  the  remains  of  what 
was  once  the  important  residence. 

Haj  Bouselham,  an  elderly  man,  accustomed  to 
all  the  luxuries  of  wealth,  succumbed  quickly  to 
the  horrors  of  the  Marrakesh  prison.  His  eldest 
son  died  soon  afterwards.  The  third,  still  a  boy, 
was  released.  Some  few  years  afterwards,  riding 
across  the  hill-tops  near  Wazzan,  a  shepherd  in 
charge  of  a  flock  of  goats  spoke  to  me.  "  You  do 
not  recognise  me,"  he  said  ;  "I  am  Mohamed,  the 
son  of  Haj  Bouselham  er-Remoush."  I  asked 


CHANGES  AND  CHANCES  317 

him  to  tell  me  his  history.  Released  from  prison, 
penniless  of  course,  he  had  taken  refuge  with  his 
mother's  people,  who  had  suffered,  too,  in  the 
general  confiscation  that  had  succeeded  his  father's 
fall.  He  was  now  a  goatherd ;  and  only  a  few 
years  before  how  often  I  had  seen  him  mounted 
on  one  or  other  of  his  fine  horses,  on  a  saddle  em- 
broidered in  gold  and  surrounded  by  his  slaves. 

A  few  years  later  I  met  him  again.  His  luck 
had  turned.  Part  of  his  confiscated  property  had 
been  acquired  again,  and  he  was  a  well-to-do 
young  tribesman  in  a  prosperous  way.  To-day, 
under  a  benigner  rule,  he  is  an  important  land- 
owner and  farmer,  and  once  more  rides  fine  horses. 

As  a  rule,  families  held  together  for  better  or 
for  worse.  Their  safety  depended  upon  their 
cohesion  and  on  their  numbers.  The  moment  a 
man  was  made  Kaid  he  collected  all  his  brothers 
and  his  uncles  and  his  cousins,  and  installed  them 
round  him.  He  exempted  them  from  taxation, 
and  let  them  rob.  It  was  the  numerical  strength 
of  his  retainers  as  much  as  his  prestige  that  kept 
him  immune  from  murder  and  revolt.  Yet  some- 
times the  families  were  split  up,  and  then  woe 
betide  them. 

Some  thirty  years  ago,  on  the  death  of  one  of 
the  great  southern  Kaids,  his  eldest  son  hurried 
to  the  Sultan's  Court,  with  mules  laden  with  money, 
to  buy  his  succession  to  his  father's  post.  There 
was  a  younger  son  who  still  was  allowed  in  the 
women's  quarters,  and  whose  mother  had  been 
the  old  Raid's  favourite  wife,  and  she  had  re- 


318  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

mained  up  to  the  time  of  his  death  his  confidante. 
She  knew  well  enough  what  would  be  her  fate 
should  the  elder  son  succeed  in  buying  the  succes- 
sion— that  she  and  her  boy  would  be  driven  out  to 
starve,  even  if  the  youth  was  not  murdered,  for 
the  feud  between  the  members  of  the  family  was 
a  deadly  one.  She  held  one  trump  card — almost 
always  the  winning  card  in  Morocco.  She  and  she 
alone  knew  where  the  dead  Raid's  secret  fortune 
was  hidden.  Under  the  charge  of  some  of  her 
relations  she  hurried  her  son  to  the  Court.  He 
arrived  to  find  that  his  half-brother  was  already 
nominated  to  the  Kaidship,  and  had  left  to  return 
to  his  tribe  that  very  morning.  Not  a  moment 
was  to  be  lost.  The  youth  and  his  advisers  sought 
the  Grand  Vizier,  and  asked  how  much  the  brother 
had  paid  for  his  succession.  The  sum  was  named, 
whereupon  the  younger  brother  offered  a  still 
greater  amount  in  return  for  a  letter  from  the 
Sultan  appointing  him  to  the  post,  with  Imperial 
authority  to  take  such  steps  as  he  might  think 
necessary  in  order  to  dispossess  his  brother.  The 
bargain  was  quickly  struck,  and,  with  a  strong 
body  of  cavalry  placed  at  his  disposal  by  the 
Sultan,  he  set  out  in  pursuit.  They  met  outside 
the  Kasba  walls,  and,  overpowered  by  the  troops, 
the  elder  son  of  the  old  Kaid  was  taken  prisoner 
and  thrown  into  a  dungeon  in  the  castle.  Needless 
to  say,  he  never  emerged  alive.  The  soldiers 
remained  a  few  days,  and  returned  to  the  Sultan, 
bearing  the  promised  price  of  office,  for  the  son 
had  dug  up,  from  under  a  great  fountain  basin 


CHANGES  AND  CHANCES  319 

in  the  courtyard  of  the  Kasba,  the  secret  treasure 
of  his  father. 

There  was  no  crime  that  the  Maghzen  would 
not  commit  for  money.  The  Sultans  not  unseldom 
carried  out  their  own  bargains.  Mulai  Hafid  had, 
rightly,  little  confidence  in  his  entourage — it  was 
a  mutual  sentiment, — and  there  was  no  financial 
transaction,  however  doubtful  its  morality,  that 
he  would  not  personally  undertake,  and  nearly 
always  with  success. 

The  whole  atmosphere  of  the  palace  was  per- 
meated with  extortion.  The  Sultans  never  hesi- 
tated playfully — but  definitely — to  take  possession 
of  any  article  that  took  their  fancy,  if  the  owner 
were  on  any  but  the  most  formal  terms.  Over 
and  over  again  I  was  the  victim  of  these  petty 
thefts — pocket-books,  sleeve-links,  necktie  pins. 
One  soon  learned  to  take  nothing  of  value  with 
one  into  the  precincts  of  the  Court.  It  must  not 
be  thought  that  presents  were  given  in  return, 
for  it  was  rare  indeed  that  any  Sultan  gave  away 
anything.  Now  and  then  they  were  generous  with  / 
some  one  else's  property,  and  even  that  was  rare. 
Visits  to  the  Court  of  Mulai  Abdul  Aziz  and  Mulai 
Hafid  were  expensive.  There  were  many  who 
thought  that  the  few  lucky  persons  to  whom  those 
closely-shut  gates  were  opened  were  making  their 
fortunes.  Some  were — those  who  had  goods  for 
sale;  but  those  who,  like  myself,  were  casual 
visitors,  paid  dearly  enough  for  their  privilege 
of  the  entree.  One  of  the  commonest  forms 
of  robbery  was  this.  On  arriving  at  the  palace 


320  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

gates  one's  horse  was  taken  possession  of  by  the 
black  slaves.  On  emerging  later  on  from  the  pre- 
cincts of  the  palace  the  slaves  were  there,  but  the 
horse  invisible.  Protests  and  threats  were  of  no 
avail ;  a  payment,  and  often  a  heavy  one,  had  to 
be  made  in  order  to  get  it  back.  At  one  time 
my  audiences  with  Mulai  Hafid,  who  was  then  at 
Fez,  were  of  almost  daily  occurrence,  and  this 
form  of  extortion  became  so  expensive  that 
eventually  I  "  struck,"  for  it  often  cost  me  from 
£2  to  £3  to  get  my  horse  back.  On  one  occasion 
I  lost  my  temper,  and  cursed  the  slaves.  Failing 
to  obtain  any  redress,  T  returned  in  a  justified 
burst  of  rage,  and  complained  to  the  Grand 
Vizier.  The  Sultan  overheard  me,  and  I  was 
summoned  to  his  presence,  where  I  spoke  equally 
forcibly.  I  told  him  that  in  Europe  people  paid 
gate-money  to  go  and  see  monstrosities  in  side- 
shows— fat  women  and  tattooed  men — but  that  I 
wasn't  going  to  be  robbed  in  this  perfectly  un- 
justifiable and  wholesale  way  each  time  I  came  to 
see  him.  It  was  he,  I  added,  who  sent  for  me. 
As  for  myself,  I  was  indifferent  to  these  inter- 
views, and  was  quite  prepared  not  to  come  again  if 
affairs  were  not  put  right.  The  Sultan  soothed  my 
injured  spirits,  spoke  a  little  of  kindness  and 
charity,  and  finished  up  by  saying,  "  You  mustn't 
judge  them  too  hardly.  You  see,  none  of  them 
receive  any  wages,  and  they  live  on  what  they 
make.  However,  I  will  have  them  punished,  so 
that  they  won't  worry  you  again,"  and  he  ordered 
the  Grand  Vizier  to  have  them  flogged.  Of  course 


CHANGES  AND  CHANCES  321 

I  intervened,  knowing  what  these  floggings  often 
were,  but  I  needn't  have  troubled.  They  were 
flogged,  but  it  was  only  a  pretence — half  a  dozen 
blows  each  that  would  scarcely  have  hurt  a  small 
child.  On  reaching  the  door  of  the  palace  a  few 
minutes  later,  my  horse  had  disappeared  again  ! 
It  had  been  taken  by  the  slaves  who  had  admin- 
istered the  bastinado,  and  who  now  demanded 
payment  for  the  punishment  they  had  inflicted 
on  their  fellow-slaves  for  an  exactly  similar  offence. 
There  was  nothing  to  be  done.  I  paid. 

It  is  all  so  different  nowadays  at  the  palace. 
The  traditional  and  historical  etiquette  is  strictly 
followed  on  all  State  occasions,  but  the  organising 
hand  is  felt.  The  slaves  and  soldiers  are  beauti- 
fully dressed.  The  Court  officials,  in  their  long 
white  robes,  are  politeness  itself,  and  an  official 
reception  by  the  present  Sultan  at  his  palace  is  a 
sight  worth  seeing.  In  the  outer  courtyards  are 
his  black  guards  in  scarlet  and  gold,  cavalry  and 
infantry,  and  his  band  of  musicians  in  their 
"  kaftans "  of  rainbow  colours,  and  the  long 
corridors  are  filled  with  the  palace  attendants.  In 
the  throne-room,  seated  on  a  divan,  the  Sultan 
receives  his  guests,  an  intelligent  affable  host. 
It  is  true  the  "  surprises  "  are  gone,  but  the  rest 
remains,  even  to  the  lions  that  roar  in  their 
cages  in  a  corner  of  the  inner  garden.  The  palaces 
are  the  same,  but  swept  and  cleaned  and  garnished, 
for  in  the  old  days  only  the  portion  of  the  great 
buildings  actually  inhabited  by  the  Sultan  was 
kept  in  repair.  I  visited  the  palaces  at  Fez  and 

x 


322  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

Marrakesh  soon  after  the  abdication  of  Mulai 
Hafid.  I  had  already  seen  certain  parts  of  them, 
but  the  presence  of  hundreds  of  women  under  the 
old  regime — many  the  widows  and  slaves  and 
descendants  of  dead  Sultans — prevented  one  visit- 
ing many  of  the  courtyards  and  buildings.  On 
the  advent  of  the  new  regime  other  arrangements 
were  made  for  these  palace  pensioners,  much  to 
then*  advantage,  and  the  restoration  of  the  palaces 
was  undertaken.  But  there  was  much  past 
restoring — courtyard  after  courtyard,  where  the 
ceilings  of  the  rooms  had  fallen  in,  and  where  it 
was  literally  unsafe  to  walk.  The  impression  that 
the  ensemble  gave  one  was  that,  with  the  excep- 
tion of  some  of  the  oldest  and  some  of  the  most 
modern  parts,  the  Sultans  had  been  terribly 
"  done  "  by  their  builders  and  the  men  responsible 
for  the  upkeep.  No  doubt  this  always  was  so. 
The  Court  functionaries  and  the  viziers  demanded 
and  received  commissions — and  what  commissions  ! 
— on  all  the  work  done  at  the  palaces.  As  a  rule, 
the  decoration  in  the  palaces  is  no  better  than 
that  existing  in  the  splendid  private  residences  of 
Fez  and  Marrakesh,  and  the  workmanship  is  often 
distinctly  inferior.  The  greater  parts  of  the  ex- 
isting palaces  were  constructed  by  Mulai  Hassen, 
the  grandfather  of  the  present  Sultan  Mulai  Yussef , 
who  died  in  1894.  He  must  have  destroyed,  in 
order  to  raise  these  acres  and  acres  of  buildings, 
much  of  what  existed  previously.  Of  the  palaces 
of  former  dynasties  nothing  but  the  merest  ruins 
remains — a  few  walls  at  Fez  of  the  palace  of  the

CHANGES  AND  CHANCES  323 

Merinides,  and  at  Marrakesh  the  great  walls  and 
enclosure  of  what  must  have  been  the  finest  of  all 
Moroccan  buildings,  the  palace  of  the  Saadien 
Sultans,  whose  dynasty  came  to  an  end  in  the 
seventeenth  century.  Their  mausoleum,  dating 
from  the  sixteenth  century,  the  most  beautiful 
building  in  Morocco,  still  remains  intact  as  an 
example  of  perfect  Moorish  art ;  and  there  is  no 
doubt,  from  contemporary  descriptions,  that  the 
neighbouring  palace  was  of  unparalleled  beauty 
and  magnificence.  The  ground-plan  of  its  great 
courtyard,  with  its  immense  water-tanks  and  its 
fountains,  can  still  be  clearly  traced  ;  while  at  one 
end,  facing  a  long  straight  tiled  walk  between  two 
of  the  great  basins,  are  the  ruins  of  the  Sultan's 
audience-chamber,  a  vast  square  room.  The  walls 
are  still  standing,  but  the  roof  has  fallen  long  ago. 
The  description  of  this  palace  in  the  days  of  its 
glory  reads  like  a  page  from  the  '  Thousand  and 
One  Nights.'  What  had  taken  a  century  to  build 
was  destroyed  in  a  day.  The  Saadien  dynasty  fell, 
and  the  cruel  despot,  Mulai  Ismail,  seized  the 
throne.  His  first  act  was  to  order  the  destruction 
of  this  famous  palace  of  his  predecessors,  and  the 
great  building  was  looted  by  the  soldiery  and  the 
crowd.  Many  of  the  old  houses  in  Marrakesh 
to-day  have  doorsteps  formed  of  small  columns, 
or  parts  of  larger  ones,  of  rare  marbles — the 
remnants  of  the  colonnades  that  once  decked  this 
magnificent  palace  of  the  most  intellectual  and 
civilised  dynasty  that  Morocco  ever  boasted. 
Perhaps  the  most  noticeable  change  that  has 


324  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

come  about  in  Morocco  is  in  the  attitude  of  the 
people  to  medical  and  surgical  aid.  The  Moor 
was  often  ready  in  the  past  to  accept  the  assist- 
ance of  European  doctors,  and  had  a  certain  faith 
in  their  medicines,  but  the  opportunities  were  few. 
The  Medical  Missions  at  Fez  and  Marrakesh  were 
well  attended  and  rendered  great  services,  and 
the  doctors  attached  to  the  Sultan's  Court  had  a 
certain  clientele.  As  a  rule,  the  native's  faith  was 
half-hearted,  sufficient  to  accept  medicines  if  no 
charge  was  made,  but  rarely  of  the  kind  that 
would  pay  a  fee.  Often,  too,  the  medicine  was 
not  taken,  and  secretly  in  his  inmost  heart  the 
patient  had  sometimes  far  more  faith  in  the  good 
that  might  accrue  from  the  presence  of  the  doctor 
than  from  the  remedies  he  recommended.  A  short 
time  since  I  experienced  a  good  example  of  this. 
A  Moor,  a  neighbour  of  mine,  was  very  ill  with 
typhus  fever,  and  at  my  recommendation  his 
women-folk  summoned  an  excellent  doctor  to 
attend  him.  I  always  accompanied  the  doctor 
on  his  visits.  The  man  was  desperately  ill.  The 
doctor  and  I  carefully  explained  to  the  women 
how  his  medicines  should  be  taken,  and  they 
apparently  followed  our  advice  to  the  letter. 
But  one  day,  arriving  unexpectedly  at  the 
house  at  the  hour  in  which  the  patient  should 
have  taken  his  medicine,  I  saw  his  wife  care- 
fully measure  the  dose  into  the  glass  and  deliber- 
ately pour  it  away.  I  remained  concealed  for  a 
few  moments,  and  then  made  my  presence  known. 
I  asked  if  the  man  had  had  his  medicine.  Hold- 


CHANGES  AND  CHANCES  325 

ing  up  the  bottle  and  pointing  to  the  diminu- 
tion in  its  contents,  the  woman  replied,  "  Yes  ;  he 
has  just  taken  it."  I  told  the  woman  that  I  had 
seen  her  throw  it  away.  She  showed  little  or  no 
confusion,  but  said,  "  The  doctor's  presence  is 
sufficient  without  his  drugs.  His  knowledge  is 
what  is  useful — who  knows  what  his  drugs  con- 
tain ?  "  I  have  experienced  many  similar  cases, 
one  that  was  so  absurd  that  it  is  worth  repeating. 
Happening  to  meet  an  old  native  who  had  a 
terrible  sore  on  the  calf  of  one  of  his  legs,  I 
asked  him  if  he  would  go  as  an  out-patient  to 
the  hospital  to  have  it  treated.  He  willingly 
assented,  and  I  wrote  on  a  visiting-card  a  line 
to  the  doctor  in  charge.  The  man  took  the 
card  and  went  his  way.  A  day  or  two  later  I 
met  him — his  leg  was  bound  up  with  a  filthy  rag. 
I  asked  him  if  he  had  been  to  the  hospital. 
"  No,"  he  replied,  "  there  was  no  need.  My  leg 
is  already  better."  I  insisted  on  seeing  the 
sore.  Under  the  reeking  bandage,  bound  across 
the  open  wound,  was  my  visiting-card  !  I  asked 
the  man  why  he  had  put  it  there.  "  Your  kind- 
ness," he  said,  "  and  the  knowledge  of  the  doctor 
to  whom  it  was  addressed  is  sufficient  cure,  so  I 
applied  the  card  to  the  sore.  It  is  better  already." 
It  wasn't.  If  anything,  it  was  distinctly  worse, 
so  I  took  the  old  man  by  force  and  walked  him  up 
to  the  hospital  myself,  where  he  was  treated. 
Finding  almost  instant  relief  from  pain,  he  followed 
the  doctor's  advice,  and  continued  his  visits  until 
his  leg  was  healed.  I  attempted  to  show  him  the 


326  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

follies  of  his  own  idea  of  cure,  but  he  would  only 
reply,  "  Your  card  was  sufficient.  It  would  have 
got  well  just  the  same  if  you  had  allowed  me  to 
leave  it  there." 

The  women  were,  and  are  still,  the  most  diffi- 
cult, but  even  in  their  case  a  great  change  has 
come  about,  and  the  Medical  Mission  to  women  at 
Fez,  so  admirably  conducted  by  two  estimable 
English — or  rather  Irish — ladies  has  rendered  im- 
mense service.  It  is  curious  that  it  is  at  Fez,  the 
most  fanatical  of  all  the  Moroccan  cities,  that  the 
most  headway  has  been  made  in  this  women's 
medical  work.  Elsewhere  there  has  been  a  con- 
siderable measure  of  success,  but  nowhere  else,  I 
think,  have  the  houses  and  hearts  of  the  native 
women  been  so  opened  to  "  Christians  "  as  they 
have  at  the  northern  capital.  No  great  function 
in  any  of  the  aristocratic  houses  is  complete  if  the 
ladies  of  the  Medical  Mission  are  not  present. 
Speaking  the  language  with  perfect  fluency,  they 
have  succeeded  by  their  good  works — and  perhaps 
still  more  by  their  good  natures — in  making  them- 
selves most  justly  and  most  sincerely  beloved. 
Part  at  least  of  the  secret  of  their  success  has  been 
what  is  often  so  wanting,  cheerfulness  and  love — 
which  constitute,  after  all,  perhaps  the  most 
important  equipment  of  real  Christianity. 

Formerly  the  mass  of  the  people  were  satisfied 
with  the  healing  power  of  their  Shereefs,  and  with 
the  charms  of  the  "  tholba,"  or  students  of  re- 
ligion. They  visited  certain  holy  places,  mostly 
tombs,  where  prayers  were  offered.  Others,  still 


CHANGES  AND  CHANCES  327 

more  ignorant,  summoned  to  the  bedside  of  their 
sick,  negro  dancers  and  the  devotees  of  the 
"  Aissaoua  "  sect,  the  noise  of  whose  music  and 
chants  should  have  been  sufficient  to  drive  away 
all  the  djinns  of  Morocco.  At  the  same  time  there 
is  a  certain  knowledge  of  herbs  existing  amongst 
the  country  people,  and  many  of  the  remedies  to 
which  they  have  recourse  are  by  no  means  to  be 
despised.  Bone-setting  is  regularly  practised,  and 
well  practised,  with  splints  of  wood  and  cane. 

The  Moors  have  long  been  aware  of  the  medi- 
cinal value  of  certain  hot  springs,  which  are  largely 
resorted  to  for  the  cure  of  skin  diseases  and  other 
maladies  common  to  the  country.  Particularly 
famous  are  the  hot  baths  of  Mulai  Yakoub,  not 
far  from  Fez,  and  the  benefit  derived  is  unques- 
tionable. I  have  known  natives,  scarcely  able  to 
ride  to  the  spot  and  covered  with  sores,  who,  after 
a  sojourn  of  from  twenty  to  thirty  days  at  this 
spot,  have  returned  healed. 

Apart  from  the  venders  of  strange  medicines 
who  can  be  seen  in  any  of  the  Moroccan  markets, 
with  their  stock-in-trade  set  out  before  them — 
hideous  dried  animals  and  the  skins  of  moth-eaten 
birds  predominating — there  are  a  certain  number 
of  native  doctors.  The  most  renowned  are  Shereefs 
from  Dades,  an  oasis  situated  to  the  south  of  the 
Great  Atlas.  These  men  pretend  to  inspired  and 
hereditary  knowledge,  and  there  is  no  doubt  that 
there  still  exists  amongst  them  some  trace  of 
medical  learning.  They  operate  for  cataract,  not 
by  removing  the  cataract,  but  by  dislocating  it, 


328  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

by  which  sight  is  often  restored,  but  without  any 
certainty  that  the  cure  is  more  than  temporary. 
They  are  also  skilful  in  removing  portions  of 
broken  skull.  There  is  no  actual  trepanning  of 
the  bone,  but  the  broken  part  is  removed  and 
replaced,  the  scalp  having  been  opened  and  drawn 
back  by  a  portion  of  the  dried  shell  of  a  gourd, 
which,  overlapping  the  uninjured  part  of  the  skull, 
covers  the  aperture  and  protects  the  brain.  The 
scalp  is  replaced  and  sewn  up. 

Perhaps  the  most  ingenious  practice  in  use 
amongst  the  Berbers  of  the  Atlas  is  the  use  of  the 
large  red  ant  for  closing  skin  wounds.  The  art  of 
sewing  up  wounds  is  known  and  practised,  but  they 
have  no  means  of  disinfecting  the  material  used, 
and  they  state  that  the  stitches  often  either  open 
or  form  sores.  They  therefore  employ  the  follow- 
ing method.  Holding  the  two  edges  of  the  skin 
together,  so  as  to  leave  a  little  of  both  edges 
protruding,  they  apply  a  living  red  ant  to  the 
wound.  The  ant  closes  his  strong  mandibles  on 
the  skin,  and  is  promptly  decapitated  with  the 
aid  of  a  pair  of  scissors.  The  mandibles  remain 
closed,  holding  the  two  edges  of  skin  together. 
As  many  as  four  or  five  of  these  "  clips  "  are  applied 
to  a  wound  of  a  few  inches  in  length.  By  the  time 
the  ant's  head  falls  away  the  wound  has  closed. 
This  system  is  in  common  use  in  the  Atlas,  and  the 
Governor  of  Marrakesh,  Haj  Thami  Glaoui,  told 
me  that  he  insists  on  his  men  using  it  in  preference 
to  sewing,  unless  the  sewing  can  be  performed  by 
a  European  doctor  with  disinfected  material.

The  Sultans  Mulai  Abdul  Aziz  and  Mulai  Hand 
both  took  an  interest  in  medicine  and  dentistry, 
and  had  confidence  in  their  doctors.  An  English 
dentist,  who  attended  the  ladies  of  the  palace  in 
the  reign  of  the  former  of  these  two  Sultans,  was 
only  allowed  to  work  on  the  mouths  of  the  inmates 
of  the  Imperial  harem  through  a  small  hole  cut 
in  the  sheet,  which  entirely  enveloped  the  patient 
as  she  sat  in  the  dentist's  chair.  So  successfully, 
however,  did  he  mend  up  the  teeth  of  the  ladies 
of  the  palace  that  the  viziers  followed  suit,  and  the 
dentist  had  a  busy  time.  The  Minister  of  Foreign 
Affairs  sent  for  me  one  day,  and  after  some  general 
remarks,  asked  me  if  I  knew  the  dentist.  I  replied 
that  I  did,  and  that  he  was  an  adept  at  his  art. 
The  Vizier  continued  that  he  knew  personally 
very  little  about  dentistry,  and  would  I  tell  him 
whether  every  time  his  wife  sneezed  it  was  neces- 
sary to  sneeze  her  new  row  of  upper  teeth  half 
across  the  room.  I  replied  that  I  doubted  whether 
this  was  an  absolute  necessity,  but  I  would  ask 
the  dentist.  I  did  so,  and  the  lady's  set  of  teeth 
was  quickly  altered  to  fit  her  better.  "It  is 
wonderful,"  said  the  Vizier  to  me  later  on  ;  "  she 
sneezes  and  sneezes  and  her  teeth  never  even 
rattle." 

In  the  days  of  Mulai  Hassen,  before  the  advent 
of  a  resident  physician  to  the  palace,  Kaid  Maclean, 
then  a  young  officer,  used  to  dabble  in  medicine, 
and  so  great  was  the  confidence  that  he  inspired 
in  the  Sultan's  eyes  that  even  His  Majesty  allowed 
himself  to  be  treated.  Kaid  Maclean's  knowledge 


330  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

was  limited  to  the  contents  of  his  medicine-chest 
and  a  book  of  explanations.  On  one  occasion  the 
ladies  of  the  palace  had  been  suffering,  from  indi- 
gestion probably,  and  at  the  same  time  some  dis- 
infectant was  required  for  some  one  in  the  palace 
who  had  been  injured  in  an  accident.  Kaid  Maclean 
sent  the  two  medicines,  with  instructions  how  they 
were  to  be  used,  but  by  some  mistake  the  ladies 
swallowed  the  compressed  tabloids  of  perman- 
ganate of  potass  instead  of  the  tonic.  The  tabloids 
dissolved  inside,  but  brought  on  violent  attacks  of 
sickness,  and  to  the  horror  of  the  Sultan  and  the 
ladies  themselves,  they  began  to  vomit  what  ap- 
peared to  be  vast  quantities  of  blood.  The  more 
sick  they  were  the  more  terrified  they  became,  and 
in  reply  to  an  anxious  message,  Kaid  Maclean 
hurried  to  the  palace.  The  Sultan  was  beside 
himself  with  fear,  but  an  explanation  was  forth- 
coming, and  the  ladies  recovered. 

Mulai  Abdul  Aziz's  first  experience  of  the  use 
of  chloroform  might  easily  have  led  to  more  serious 
results.  Dr  Verdon,  his  English  doctor,  had 
operated  on  a  slave  under  chloroform,  and  the 
Sultan  had  been  present.  The  operation  over, 
His  Majesty  retired  into  the  palace  carrying  with 
him  a  large  bottle  of  the  anaesthetic.  The  doctor 
tried  to  obtain  possession  of  the  bottle,  but  in  vain, 
and  all  he  could  do  was  to  warn  His  Majesty  to  be 
very  careful  with  it.  He  no  doubt  was,  for  appa- 
rently nobody  died;  but  rumour  has  it  that  his 
ladies  lay  all  over  the  palace  as  insensible  as  logs 
of  wood — for  he  had  a  grand  chloroforming  evening

all  to  himself.  Mulai  Hafid,  too,  quite  appreciated 
the  use  of  chloroform,  and  insisted  on  its  being 
administered  to  a  lion  that  was  suffering  from  over- 
grown toe-nails.  The  lion,  whose  temper  was  not 
of  the  best,  took  none  too  kindly  to  the  whole 
operation,  which  was,  however,  eventually  success- 
fully performed,  to  the  satisfaction  of  His  Shereefian 
Majesty. 

To-day  the  people  flock  in  thousands  to  the  hos- 
pitals and  dispensaries  which  the  French  have 
opened  throughout  the  length  and  breadth  of  their 
Protectorate.  There  is  yet  room  for  more  medical 
work,  for  disease  is  rife,  but  what  has  already 
been  accomplished  is  admirable.  The  Moor,  who 
would  never  have  thought  of  accepting  the  assist- 
ance of  a  doctor  in  the  old  days,  now  hurries  to  the 
nearest  dispensary  as  soon  as  he  feels  ill,  and  any 
man  who  meets  with  an  accident  is  immediately 
taken  by  his  fellow- workmen  to  the  native  hospital. 
Crowds  patiently  wait  their  turn  in  the  gardens 
and  corridors,  and  the  women's  days  are  almost  as 
congested  as  are  those  for  the  men.  Whatever  may 
be  the  people's  real  sentiments  toward  Europeans, 
their  confidence  in  "  Christian  "  doctors  is  undis- 
putable.  Yet  the  very  people  who  crowd  to  the 
flock  for  medical  aid  would  probably  not  acknow- 
ledge that  any  change  has  taken  place  in  their 
views.  They  don't  realise  that  only  ten  years  ago, 
even  if  the  possibilities  had  existed,  they  would 
never  have  dared  to  show  this  outward  respect 
for  and  belief  in  the  skill  of  the  "  infidel."  But  the 
change  has  come  gradually,  and  is  unnoticed  by/ 


332  MOROCCO  THAT  WAS 

those  to  whom  it  is  owing.  The  same  sequence  of 
mentality  is  noticeable  in  many  other  ways.  The 
"  universities  " — medarsas — of  Fez  and  Marrakesh, 
closed  for  centuries  to  Europeans,  are  now  open 
once  more  to  the  Christian  visitor,  who  is  allowed 
to  enter  and  admire  these  gems  of  Moorish  archi- 
tecture. The  religious  authorities  could  no  longer 
insist  on  their  being  kept  closed  when  they  acknow- 
ledged that  a  few  centuries  ago  Christian  scholars 
were  actually  being  educated  in  their  precincts, 
so  after  a  little  hesitation  they  decided  to  permit 
the  "  medarsas "  being  visited.  The  authorities 
of  the  Service  des  Beaux-Arts  immediately  set 
about  the  restoration  of  these  architectural  master- 
pieces. At  first  the  students  were  shocked  at  the 
presence  of  the  Christian,  and  on  one  of  my  visits 
to  the  beautiful  "  medarsa  "  of  Ben  Youssef  at 
Marrakesh,  they  complained  rather  bitterly  that 
the  French  architects  were  restoring  the  old  work 
and  taking  liberties  with  the  structure.  They 
would  rather,  they  said,  have  it  left  alone  in  its 
ruined  condition  than  have  it  tampered  with  by 
"  unbelievers." 

A  year  later  I  returned  to  the  "  medarsa." 
The  same,  or  many  of  them  the  same,  scholars 
were  there.  The  Service  des  Beaux  -  Arts  had 
restored  one  side  of  the  great  courtyard,  but 
were  waiting  for  further  funds  before  beginning 
the  rest.  Again  the  scholars  -complained,  but 
their  complaint  was  a  different  one — the  French 
architects  had  abandoned  their  work.  What 
right  had  they  to  leave  it  unfinished  ?  Would  I 


CHANGES  AND  CHANCES  333 

use  my  influence  to  see  that  the  restorations  were 
continued  and  completed  ?  I  reminded  them  of 
their  complaint  of  only  a  year  ago,  and  of  their 
objection  to  the  work  being  undertaken  at  all. 
They  laughed,  and  replied,  "  Well,  you  see, 
yesterday  was  yesterday,  and  to-day  is  to-day."
